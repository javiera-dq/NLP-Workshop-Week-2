If you suffered a loss in Atlas Lithium during the relevant time frame, you have until August 1, 2023\u00a0to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Discovery Area \n\n\n      \u2022 Lithium and Tellurium Exploration Planning Underway \n\n\nVANCOUVER, BC June 8, 2023 - CAT Strategic Metals Corporation (CSE: CAT, OTC: CATTF, FRA: 8CH) (\"CAT\" or the \"Company\") announces that consulting geologists Rick Redfern and Patrick Laforest are on-site conducting work on the Company's Gold Jackpot property located NE of Elko, Nevada. The recent discovery of highly anomalous lithium values reported by Surge Battery Metals Inc. (\"Surge\") on its Nevada North Lithium Project, located only ~1.5 miles from Gold Jackpot, has prompted CAT management to shift the Company's primary focus to lithium and tellurium exploration activities on the Nevada property. \n    \n\nNEW CLAIMS STAKED \n\n    As a result of this shift in focus, CAT has staked a further 12 claims to the west of its existing claim block, increasing the Company's land holdings to 1508 acres (610 hectares). The geological setting underlying the newly staked claims is thought to be an extension of the system on Gold Jackpot that shows the same late N-S faulting - as reported by Surge - that could have acted as traps, or feeder faults, for the formation of lithium deposits. Alternatively, these N-S faults could have been hydrothermal vent structures that fed volcanic-related hydrothermal lithium-rich fluids up from depth. If this is confirmed to be the same, or similar, geological setting in which Surge reported its lithium discovery, then CAT has added considerable value to its shareholders and increased the possibility of locating a significant lithium discovery of its own. \n\nGOLD JACKPOT MINERALIZATION \n\n    Gold Jackpot has had substantial historical exploration completed from the 1980's to early 2000's, which was predominantly focused on delineating an area of gold-silver-copper mineralization but was never explored for lithium specifically. However, the most recent review by CAT consulting geologist, Rick Redfern, of rock chip sampling contained in the database identified 6 samples with unexpected highly anomalous values of lithium; up to 158.5 ppm. These chip samples - which were collected as part of previous regional gold exploration activities - demonstrate the unexpected strong potential for a lithium discovery for CAT, given what Surge has discovered on its property. Other additional historic assay results returned gold values up to 4.84 g/t, silver values of up to 239 g/t, and tellurium values of up to 339 g/t. Tellurium is interesting because it is one of the least common elements on Earth. Most rocks contain an average of about 3 parts per billion tellurium, making it rarer than the rare earth elements and eight times less abundant than gold (source: USGS) and is used primarily in the solar panel industry. \n\n      Further scrutiny of the available Gold Jackpot database revealed that from 1988-1990, Tenneco Minerals engaged in various exploration and sampling activities that included a 28-hole reverse 1010 -789 West Pender Street, Vancouver, BC V6C 1H2 \n\n\n      circulation drilling program. These holes were mostly very shallow, +/- 100 metres, and were designed to test for open-pitable gold and silver contained in strongly altered Paleozoic host rocks in an area right in the middle of the property. Following this drill program Tenneco abandoned the project and the area is now known as the Stag's Leap Porphyry-Diatreme Target, which was identified as such by Mr. Redfern. \n    \n\nGOLD JACKPOT EXPLORATION \n\n\n      In addition to staking new ground adjacent to CAT's existing claim blocks, the geological team is conducting a reconnaissance of the most promising areas where positive and encouraging results were previously reported. This survey is the foundation of CAT's next stage exploration work program and will be instrumental in producing an NI 43-101 Technical Report as previously stated. \n    \n\n      Next stage exploration activities are expected to include a conciliation of the historical data of the property with a goal of widening the prospecting aim of the newly added Lithium potential. Following this further review, the Company will be able to generate additional prospecting targets that will enable the geological team to return to the property over the summer to conduct further exploration. In the field, the geologist's primary goal is to identify the potential lithium bearing horizon, in addition to collecting additional structural data to focus on generating additional drilling targets. This ongoing field visit is a prerequisite to the launch of a summer work program. \n    \n\n      Mr. Richard R. Redfern, M.S., C.P.G. No. 10717, is the qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 who has examined the property on the ground, and who reviewed the geological information available from public sources related to the property and is responsible for approving the technical contents of this press release. \n    \n\nAbout CAT Strategic Metals Corporation (CAT) \n\n\n      CAT Strategic Metals' corporate strategy, as reflected in its overall Mission Statement, is to source, identify, acquire and advance property interests located in mineral districts proven to have world-class potential, primarily lithium, tellurium, gold, silver and copper. In addition to the Gold Jackpot strategic metals property located NE of Elko, Nevada, in the Pequop gold-copper-lithium trend with multiple targets for gold-silver, copper, tellurium , and potential lithium, CAT has the South Preston Uranium Project in the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, the Burntland Project located northeast of St. Quentin in the Restigouche County, New Brunswick, Canada, directed at the exploration and development of several Skarn-hosted copper-silver, gold targets. CAT's shares trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the trading symbol \"CAT\", and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol \"8CH\". \n    \n\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD \n\n\n      Robert Rosner Chairman, President & CEO \n    \n\n      Further information regarding the Company can be found on SEDAR at www.SEDAR.com, by visiting the Company's website www.catstrategic.com or by contacting the Company directly at (604) 674-3145. \n    \n\n      Neither Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. \n    \n\n      We seek safe harbour. \n    \nAttachments\n\n\n            Original Link\n          \n\n            Original Document\n          \n\n            Permalink\n          \n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nCAT Strategic Metals Corp. published this content on 08 June 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

The company owns the largest hard-rock lithium mineral property portfolio in Brazil and has ten drills operating. The company has signed a $65 million memorandum of understanding with Mitsui & Co. Many investors have counted on this memorandum of understanding more than its real value. However, it is just a nonbinding agreement that states each party's intentions to take action. It might turn into money, and it might not. On the other hand, there is an agreement that investors almost ignored it. On 2 May 2023, ATLX announced a $20 million non-dilutive funding from Lithium Royalty Corp. (OTCPK:LITRF). This $20 million funding, which has already made ATLX able to follow its plans, means a lot for the company's drilling projects. In the company's financial results in the next few quarters of 2023, you may not see significant revenues from lithium production or any revenues at all. However, you might see a stronger cash position and a company with significantly more assets. Investing in ATLX is investing in its future, and the recent statements of the company, combined with the significant investment of Lithium Royalty Corporation in ATLX, mean that compared with three months ago, the future has become brighter. For those who want to make sure that ATLX is profitable first, then start investing in the stock, ATLX may not be a good choice. However, for those who want to invest in the company's future regarding the existing risks, ATLX can be a buy. Financial results As of 31 March 2023, ATLX's cash and cash equivalents were $4.98 million, compared with $0.28 million on 31 December 2022. As a result of higher cash and cash equivalents, and higher intangible assets, the company's total assets increased from $5.68 million on 31 December 2022 to $12.39 million on 31 March 2023. On the other hand, ATLX's total liabilities decreased from $2.88 million on 31 December 2022 to $2.54 million on 31 March 2023. It means that in the first quarter of 2023, ATLX made significant equity financing. ATLX's weighted number of common shares outstanding increased from 4.3 million in 4Q 2022 to 6.6 million in 1Q 2023. However, the company still does not have revenues or cost of revenues. All the expenses of the company are devoted to expenses such as professional fees, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation, and exploration costs, which all of them hiked in the first quarter of 2023. For now, the company is expanding without making any money. As a result, its net loss attributable to Atlas Lithium Corporation stockholders increased from $0.83 million in 4Q 2022 to $3.99 million in 1Q 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, ATLX used $3.66 million in its operating activities, compared with $0.50 million in 4Q 2022. Also, due to a significant increase in intangible assets (including mining rights), the company's use in investing activities increased from $0.15 million in 4Q 022 to $1.28 million in 1Q 2023. On 19 January 2023, the company acquired five mineral rights totaling 1091 hectares (2696 acres) owned by an unrelated Brazilian mining enterprise. Finally, as a result of net proceeds from the sale of common stock, ATLX's net cash provided by financing activities increased from $0.62 million in 4Q 2022 to $9.56 million in 1Q 2023. Developments and potentials Atlas Lithium plans to develop and own 100% of a processing facility which might result in producing 150000 tons of lithium concentrate per year. However, the company is in the initial stages of its development and no one can be sure that ATLX will be able to do so. All of ATLX's mineral projects are located in Brazil, and the company believes that it holds the largest portfolio of exploration properties for battery minerals in Brazil. On 4 April 2023, the company announced it has identified lithium mineralization that is both superficial and high-grade; however, it didn't mean so much. The announced results just meant a higher likelihood of an open pit operation and extraction. On 24 April 2023, Atlas Lithium announced strong metallurgical test results for its hard-rock lithium project in Brazil. The company explained that all metallurgical test work targets exceeded, and announced achieving heavy liquid separation (HLS) with a very high grade of 7.00% lithium oxide. \"Atlas Lithium is advancing well towards our goal of becoming a leading provider of lithium concentrate,\" the CEO stated. As a result of these two announcements, the company's stock price soared from $18 on 4 April 2023 to $42 on 2 May 2023, then dropped to $17 with huge traded volumes in two days. The irony was that the stock's price dropped amid one of the company's biggest achievements. On 2 May 2023, ATLX announced that the company sold 3.0% of Gross Overriding Revenue royalty to Lithium Royalty Corporation, for $20 million, which was the largest lithium royalty deal in Brazil. As the company provided a new corporate update on 5 May 2023, explaining its operational progress in the past few months by mentioning that the company has 10 active diamond-core drills advancing its 40000-meter lithium exploration campaign, the stock's price jumped to $28; however, it dropped again. Now, the stock is trading at around $22 per share, which I believe that it is not representing the company's $20 million non-dilutive funding on 2 May 2022. Lithium Royalty Corporation is a known lithium-focused royalty company, and its investment in ATLX is not something that can be simply ignored. Also, it is important to know that on 30 May 2023, Atlas Lithium announced its longest down-drill lithium mineralization of the company's exploration campaign. The fact is that Lithium Royalty Corporation's $20 million investment in ATLX has made the company able to fund its planned drilling campaign and can continue progressing in the future months. However, the stock's price is not reacting accordingly. The reason might be its sudden soar between 4 April to 2 May, and its sudden plunge between 2 May to 4 May, followed by another jump and drop during a few days. These sudden massive increases and decreases have made the investors not trust the company's performance. In the past two months, the market overreacted to the less important announcement of the company and almost ignored the biggest announcement (a $20 million non-dilutive funding). On 5 June 2023, a lawsuit, on behalf of those who purchased ATLX shares between 25 March 2023 to 4 May 2023, hit the stock, alleging that the company made materially false and misleading statements about its success in mining lithium and other battery materials. However, the company's statements about its progress were not misleading. It is a mining company with considerable mining rights and resources that may not reach its goals soon, or at all. Investing in ATLX is very risky and you should just devote a small portion of your portfolio to it. On the other hand, once the company starts producing lithium, ATLX's stock price might soar. End note  For those who want to devote a small portion of their portfolio to ATLX, the company's recent developments, and a $20 million non-dilutive funding must be considered. You should take into account that the company may not have significant revenues from lithium production in the following quarters. However, once it starts producing lithium, it will reward its shareholders and the stock's current price might be a good entry point.

HIGHLIGHTSOption Agreement signed that, subject to the satisfaction of conditions, grants Winsome the option to acquire Jackpot Property, located immediately north of Winsome\u2019s Adina Project to increase Adina project area by 50%.Winsome\u2019s footprint at Adina will, on exercise of the option, expand to 44km2, opening up further exploration targets as well as providing flexibility in site layout and infrastructure as development progresses.Following exercise, Winsome\u2019s landholding in the world class James Bay lithium region will increase to over 870km2. Following exercise of the Option, Winsome\u2019s 100%-owned footprint of the Adina Project will increase to 44km2 and Winsome\u2019s tenure in the James Bay area to over 871.5km2, maintaining its position as one of the largest landholders in this highly prospective region.WINSOME\u2019S MANAGING DIRECTOR CHRIS EVANS SAID:\u201cWith Adina moving into a development phase later this year, taking an option on attractive terms over the Jackpot property is a strategic move to not only give us access to further exploration upside around Adina but also flexibility in future design of site layout and infrastructure footprints. Work continues apace with plans for mobilisation of the fourth rig to the Adina site and we look forward to further drilling results in the near future as we look towards our Maiden Resource later in 2023.\u201dFigure 1: Plan showing location of Jackpot Property relative to AdinaProject SummaryThe Jackpot Property is located immediately north of Adina and comprises 29 claims covering 14.9km2 (Figure 1).Regional geological interpretation by the Quebec Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9nergie et des Ressources naturelles (Department of Energy and Natural Resources) (MERN) indicates the project area is principally underlain by the Joubert Suite, a suite of intrusive tonalites and granodiorites. The Joubert Suite intrudes the adjacent greenstones of the Trieste Formation, which hosts the lithium-bearing pegmatite swarms at Adina, and has been postulated as contributing to the formation of these pegmatites.Winsome\u2019s geological work has shown there is potential for the contact with the greenstone belt to lie further north, closer to the boundary between the Adina Project and the Jackpot Property. The intersection of mineralised pegmatites below the Adina Main Zone data1 also gives encouragement for further pegmatite swarms to be found to the north of Adina and as previously announced, a number of gravity targets have been identified in this area2.

The Eastern Goldfields project area comprises eighteen tenements (eight ELs and ten EL applications) that are strategically located over areas that the Company believes are highly prospective for multi-commodities, particularly lithium, gold, REE and copper. Highlights:Fieldwork underway on highly prospective Eastern Goldfields tenements, following recently announced agreement with Outback Minerals Pty Ltd1.Multiple outcropping pegmatites, up to ~100m in strike length, mapped at the Breakaway Dam / Alexandra Bore project area (E29/1037), contiguous to Forrestania\u2019s existing tenement position. The recently acquired tenements have never previously been explored for lithium.Outcropping pegmatites also mapped at the Bonnie Vale project area (E15/1632), near Coolgardie.Mapping and sampling will continue to assist in defining targets for a maiden drilling programme. Forrestania Resources\u2019 Managing Director Michael Anderson commented:\u201cThe rationale for entering into the option agreement with Outback Minerals already appears to be justified. The confirmed presence of multiple pegmatite outcrops, some up to ~100m in strike length, provides us with additional confidence in the discovery potential on these tenements. We are prioritising our activities to prepare for a maiden drilling programme, as soon as possible.\u201dDiscussion:The Company has recently completed a mapping and reconnaissance field trip to the newly acquired Eastern Goldfields tenements. The focus of the trip was to further enhance the Company\u2019s geological understanding of the project areas, as well as to further assess the potential for lithium mineralisation.The newly acquired tenements (Alexandra Bore / Breakaway Dam project (E29/1037 and E29/1036) have never previously been explored for their lithium potential, with previous historic exploration instead focussed on copper, gold and nickel, despite the known presence of pegmatites.The Bonnie Vale project area (E15/1534 and E15/1632) has also never been explored for its lithium potential, with previous explorers focussing on the tenement\u2019s gold prospectivity. Mapping and field work is on-going, but the company is pleased to announce that additional pegmatites have been mapped at both project areas, specifically on E29/1037 and E15/1632. Figure 1: The Eastern Goldfields project area (recent acquisitions highlighted in blue)Alexandra Bore / Breakaway Dam Project (E29/1037 and E29/1036) and Balarky Prospect (E29/1158)The Company recently completed a mapping and reconnaissance field trip to the newly acquired Alexandra Bore / Breakaway Dam project area (see Figure 2).Pegmatites have previously been mapped by the company at the Alexandra Bore / Breakaway Dam project areas1 and ongoing field reconnaissance is currently underway.Significantly, additional pegmatite outcrops have recently been mapped at surface by Company geologists, with outcropping pegmatites ranging from ~43m and up to ~100m in strike length (see Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6). These pegmatites were located approximately 300m apart and have never previously been tested for lithium or LCT pathfinder minerals. Indeed, the Alexandra Bore / Breakaway Dam project area has only previously been explored for copper and gold1 and the potential for lithium mineralisation has yet to be fully evaluated. Importantly, these outcrops are all located within the mapped greenstone or close to greenstone/granite contacts (as interpreted by GSWA).

The firm\u2019s strategy is to identify and invest in advanced and high-value mining projects throughout East, Central and Southern Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\n\nZimpapers reviews newspaper prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n June 8, 2023\n\n\nZimpapers reviews newspaper prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\n\n1.4bn Chinese market ready for Zimbabwe ...\n\n\n\n\nPolitical Editor \u00a0 ZIMBABWE should leverage on its huge potential and ramp up exports to China, which is home to 1.4 billion people, the incoming Chinese Ambassador Mr Zhou Ding said.

(\"Atlas Lithium\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ATLX) and certain of its officers, on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Atlas Lithium securities between March 25, 2022 and May 3, 2023, (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm\u2019s site: www.bgandg.com/atlx.\n\n\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws.\n\n\nThe Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company overstated the success of its lithium mining and misrepresented the nature of its Brazilian mineral rights; (ii) in connection with these misrepresentations, Atlas Lithium conducted deceptive promotions to artificially inflate the value of the Company's stock; (iii) the foregoing conduct was designed to allow CEO Fogassa and other Company insiders to sell shares back into the market for a profit before the true nature of Atlas Lithium's business was revealed; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.\n\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Bleecker Street Research published a report entitled \"Atlas Lithium: First Comes The Pump Now Here Comes the Dump\" and on this news, Atlas Lithium's stock price fell $12.95 per share, or 43.34%, to close at $16.93 per share on May 4, 2023.\n\n\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint you can visit the firm\u2019s site: www.bgandg.com/atlx or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Law Clerk and Client Relations Manager, Yael Nathanson of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 212-697-6484. If you suffered a loss in Atlas Lithium, you have until August 1, 2023, to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\n\n\nBronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC represents investors in securities fraud class actions and shareholder derivative suits.

(CSE: HZ) (OTC Pink: HZLIF) (FSE: QE2) (the \"Company\"), a Company focused on lithium exploration and novel extraction technologies, is pleased to provide an update on the field exploration activities that commenced on May 2, 2023, at its Lucky Mica Property (the \"Property\") in Maricopa County in Arizona, USA.To date the field team has completed general prospecting, mapping and sampling of pegmatite outcrops and structural mapping on the Property. The team has identified an abundance of 'new' previously unmapped and sampled pegmatites in three clusters as shown in Figure 1 below. These pegmatites are described to occur as 2-6m wide bodies potentially up to 50-100m long and appear to occur conformant with the local metamorphic foliation and may vary in dip from shallow to steeply dipping. The predominant quartz, feldspar pegmatites are more resistant to erosion and weathering and are frequently exposed along ridgelines, and within creek beds, and the identified pegmatites appear to be hosted within weathered greenstone locally mapped as amphibolite (Figure 2). The pegmatitic mineralogy is generally consistent with the lepidolite and spodumene bearing pegmatite identified in the Lucky Mica region on the Property which have returned results up to 7.5% Li2O. A total of approximately 250 samples have been collected from these clusters and an additional 100 will be collected on the Property before the team leaves the field next week. All samples with be delivered to SGS Laboratories in Phoenix, AZ for analysis with results expected in 6-8 weeks.  Figure 1: Mapped pegmatitic showings predominantly E-W striking (50-100m long, approx. 5m wide) and typically comprising a dominant quartz + feldspar + mica mineralogy with few Li-bearing minerals identified.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9656/169089_0ea0acd3849fe839_002full.jpg.Figure 2: Typical exposed pegmatite outcrop - dominantly quartz + feldspar + muscovite, within weathered amphibolite schist.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9656/169089_0ea0acd3849fe839_003full.jpg.Ongoing Remote Sensing, geophysical analysis and lithostructrual interpretation are expected to proceed over the next 6-8 weeks with delivery of the results to coincide with the returned analytical results of the approximate 350 samples collected in May. This data acquisition, processing and geological interpretations over the Property will be completed by Axiom Geophysics and Remote Sensing (www.axiomgeophysics.com) prior to the follow up trenching phase this fall. The results of these various exploration methods will be compiled and utilized in the strategic development of the trenching program both in the known Lucky Mica area as well as within the regions of the 3 newly discovered pegmatite clusters. Additional prospecting and sampling will be conducted within priority zones to further determine a broader geochemical understanding of the Property.

Historical information contained in this news release is derived from previous workers previous reports and has not been field verified.For more information about the Property and the recommended work program, see the technical report prepared by Lee R. Beasley, CPG, MSc, titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report, Lucky Mica Project, Arizona,\" with an effective date of November 8, 2022, as filed on the Company's profile on www.sedar.com. JAMES BAY, QUEBEC LITHIUM EXPLORATION PROGRAMS HALTED DUE TO FIRE DANGERHertz Lithium sympathizes with the current fire danger around all of Canada and in the James Bay Region of Quebec and respects the Quebec Governments mandate to cease all mineral exploration activities in the province until the fire danger subsides.  Furthermore, Hertz management respects decisions by James Bay Lithium exploration companies which include Patriot Battery Metals at their Corvette Lithium Discovery, Winsome Resources at their Adina Lithium Discovery and early-stage explorers Q2 Metals Corp, Ophir Gold, Champion Electric as well companies funded by Hertz Lithium's strategic investor Coloured Ties Capital (TIE) to halt all exploration programs until the fire danger has been mitigated.  Coloured Ties   associated lithium companies active in the James Bay lithium exploration include Superior Mining International and private companies, Canuck Lithium, Quebec Pegmatite and Agastya Minerals.Management is hopeful that weather conditions will quickly change, and rain will mitigate the fire danger in the coming days and weeks, but the fact remains the lithium prospects in James Bay Region are going to remain very strong and survive any fire danger time periods.About Hertz Lithium Inc. The Company is a British Columbia based mineral exploration company primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The Company's lithium exploration project, the Lucky Mica Project, is located along the Arizona Pegmatite Belt in the Maricopa County of Arizona, USA.

The new Titan X Lithium Project is located in northeastern Tanzania, a country rich in mineral wealth and active in the EV battery-material supply chain (i.e. the recent Tesla-Uranex deal.) Titan X sits directly south of and is directly adjacent to, the massive Titan 1 lithium project of Titan Lithium (OTC: CDSG). The project is located near excellent infrastructure with access by tertiary roads off of a paved highway with a nearby rail line, two international airports at Arusha and Kilimanjaro, and an ocean shipping port in the city of Tanga. To date, the Titan 1 project (CDSG) has returned unparalleled results reporting widespread high-grade lithium within clay soil. Titan 1 covers over 65 square kilometers and grades approximately 1% Li2O. In some samples towards the south-end of Titan 1, very near to \u201cTitan X\u201d, the recorded grades were up to 4.8% Li2O. Harp Sangha, Chairman of Barrel Energy states, \u201cWe are very pleased to have been able to locate such a top-tier lithium project for Barrel. The Titan 1 project has every indication to be a world-class standout and our Titan X project holds great promise as recent prospecting returned surface lithium grades similar to Titan 1.\u201d  Location of the Titan X south of the Titan 1 Project. Please click here to view image The Titan X Lithium Project measures 97.4 square kilometers in size (approx. 24,075 acres) and spans a sparsely vegetated playa basin that is likely the southward extension of the generally north-south trending Titan 1 mineralization. Tanzania has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa and mining is one of the core sectors for the nation. Barrel\u2019s management has a wealth of in-country experience and the Company is presently reviewing additional geologic targets to expand our battery metal portfolio. About Barrel: Barrel Energy Inc., (OTC Markets: BRLL) is focused on several ventures within the green energy and battery minerals sector and the rapid development of valuable production opportunities throughout North America and abroad. The company holds important joint venture agreements to advance technologies and processes for Electric Vehicle batteries.

(\u201cAmerican Lithium\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V:LI | NASDAQ:AML| Frankfurt:5LA1) announces that it has entered into a definitive arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Friday\u2019s Dog Holdings Inc. (TSX-V:FRDY), a public company currently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and to be renamed International Uranium Corp. (\u201cInternational Uranium\u201d), dated June 6, 2023, pursuant to which it will transfer ownership (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) of its Macusani Uranium Project (the \u201cMacusani Project\u201d). In accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the Company will transfer ownership of a wholly owned Peruvian subsidiary which holds the mineral concessions comprising the Macusani Project to International Uranium. In connection with the Transaction, International Uranium will consolidate (the \u201cConsolidation\u201d) its outstanding share capital of 84,069,352 common shares on the basis of one post-Consolidation common share for every four-and-one-half pre-Consolidation shares resulting in 18,682,078 being outstanding and will issue to the Company 80,000,000 post-Consolidation common shares (the \u201cConsideration Shares\u201d) in consideration for the Macusani Project. On Closing, International Uranium has committed to have a minimum of C$5,000,000 in available cash and concurrently with the entering into of the Arrangement Agreement has announced a brokered private placement of subscription receipts (the \u201cConcurrent Financing\u201d) led by Eight Capital and National Bank Financial Inc. with a syndicate that includes Canaccord Genuity Corp., Clarkson Securities AS and TD Securities raise gross proceeds of C$15,000,000. On a pro forma basis, there is expected to be approximately 128,862,078 common shares of International Uranium outstanding upon completion of the Transaction assuming the minimum amount is raised in the Concurrent Financing. International Uranium will also reconstitute its board of directors and management to consist of nominees of the Company.\u00a0\u00a0 Further details regarding the terms of the Concurrent Financing and the proposed composition of the board of directors and management are set out in today\u2019s announcement by International Uranium. Through the Transaction, the Company aims to recognize the market value of the advanced, development stage Macusani Project for the benefit of its shareholders by creating an independent, well financed, uranium-focused, publicly traded company, International Uranium, which will drive this large-scale uranium project forward through feasibility and beyond. International Uranium will immediately benefit from the work done to date by American Lithium on the Macusani Project and in particular a highly robust PEA, advanced metallurgy and drill permits which have been filed for the next phases of drilling and are expected to be finalized shortly.\u00a0\u00a0 The Transaction will also enable American Lithium to better focus all its efforts on advancing its two premier lithium projects, TLC in Nevada, and Falchani in Peru. Simon Clarke, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, \u201cWe are pleased to move forward with spinning out this large-scale and advanced-stage uranium project for the benefit of our shareholders.\u00a0\u00a0 The Macusani Project is one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped uranium projects whose ease of extraction, \u201cnear surface\u201d and high purity characteristics position it with the potential to be one of the lowest cost sources of uranium globally. With mounting concerns around energy security and climate change, Macusani is strategically located in the Americas, and we believe it can play a large role in the transition to zero emission base-load electricity generation that the world requires. To fully realize its potential and to provide maximum value to our shareholders we believe it needs to be in a stand-alone public company.\u201d Details of the Transaction Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the Transaction will involve the transfer of ownership of Macusani Uranium S.A.C., a Peruvian subsidiary of the Company, to International Uranium in consideration for receipt of the Consideration Shares. Immediately following receipt of the Consideration Shares, the Company intends to distribute (the \u201cDistribution\u201d) the Consideration Shares to its existing common shareholders on a pro rata basis. The Distribution will be conducted along with the Transaction under a plan of arrangement in accordance with the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Company has not yet determined a record date for shareholders entitled to participate in the Distribution and will issue a further news release once such a determination has been made. Following completion of the Transaction, International Uranium will have ownership and control over the Macusani Project. It is intended that management of International Uranium will be comprised of nominees of the Company, and the Company will arrange for the continuity of the existing development team in Peru. The Company will retain the right to participate in any future commercially viable discoveries of lithium mineralization on the Macusani Project and the concessions transferred to International Uranium as part of the Transaction. International Uranium will be permitted to participate in any future commercially viable discoveries of uranium mineralization on the remaining mineral concessions which comprise the Company\u2019s Falchani lithium project and associated exploration concessions which have been retained by the Company. The Company and International Uranium are at arms-length. Completion of the Transaction remains subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of the approval of the shareholders of each of the Company and International Uranium, the approval of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, International Uranium having received approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, completion of the Consolidation and the Concurrent Financing, International Uranium having no less than C$5,000,000 of available cash on hand prior to completion of the Concurrent Financing and after deducting the expenses associated with the Transaction, International Uranium having completed the divestiture of its existing business, and the completion of customary closing deliverables. The Transaction constitutes a \u201cChange of Business\u201d for International Uranium, in accordance with the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange, as a result trading in the common shares of International Uranium has been halted pending completion of certain required filings with the TSX Venture Exchange and is expected to remain halted until completion of the Transaction. About American Lithium American Lithium is actively engaged in the development of large-scale lithium projects within mining-friendly jurisdictions throughout the Americas. The Company is currently focused on the continued development of its strategically located TLC Lithium Claystone Project in the richly mineralized Esmeralda lithium district in Nevada, as well as continuing to advance its Falchani Lithium Project and Macusani Uranium Projects in southeastern Peru. All three projects, TLC, Falchani and Macusani have been through robust preliminary economic assessments, exhibit strong significant expansion potential and enjoy strong community support. Pre-feasibility is well advanced at Falchani and has commenced at TLC.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking InformationThis news release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements (collectively \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the ability to appeal the judicial ruling, the anticipated timing for completion of the PEA, and any other statements regarding the business plans, expectations and objectives of American Lithium. Forward-looking statements are frequently identified by such words as \"may\", \"will\", \"plan\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"estimate\", \"intend\", \u201cindicate\u201d, \u201cscheduled\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d, \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cpotential\u201d, \u201csubject\u201d, \u201cefforts\u201d, \u201coption\u201d and similar words, or the negative connotations thereof, referring to future events and results. Forward-looking statements are based on the current opinions and expectations of management and are not, and cannot be, a guarantee of future results or events. Although American Lithium believes that the current opinions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available at the time, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements since American Lithium can provide no assurance that such opinions and expectations will prove to be correct. All forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to: American Lithium\u2019s ability to achieve its stated goals;, which could have a material adverse impact on many aspects of American Lithium\u2019s businesses including but not limited to: the ability to access mineral properties for indeterminate amounts of time, the health of the employees or consultants resulting in delays or diminished capacity, social or political instability in Peru which in turn could impact American Lithium\u2019s ability to maintain the continuity of its business operating requirements, may result in the reduced availability or failures of various local administration and critical infrastructure, reduced demand for the American Lithium\u2019s potential products, availability of materials, global travel restrictions, and the availability of insurance and the associated costs; the judicial appeal process in Peru, and any and all future remedies pursued by American Lithium and its subsidiary Macusani to resolve the title for 32 of its concessions; the ongoing ability to work cooperatively with stakeholders, including but not limited to local communities and all levels of government; the potential for delays in exploration or development activities; the interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of mineral deposits; the possibility that any future exploration, development or mining results will not be consistent with our expectations; risks that permits will not be obtained as planned or delays in obtaining permits; mining and development risks, including risks related to accidents, equipment breakdowns, labour disputes (including work stoppages, strikes and loss of personnel) or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in exploration and development; risks related to commodity price and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; risks related to foreign operations; the cyclical nature of the industry in which American Lithium operates; risks related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms or delays in obtaining governmental approvals; risks related to environmental regulation and liability; political and regulatory risks associated with mining and exploration; risks related to the uncertain global economic environment and the effects upon the global market generally, any of which could continue to negatively affect global financial markets, including the trading price of American Lithium\u2019s shares and could negatively affect American Lithium\u2019s ability to raise capital and may also result in additional and unknown risks or liabilities to American Lithium. Other risks and uncertainties related to prospects, properties and business strategy of American Lithium are identified in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of American Lithium\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis filed on May 29, 2023, and in recent securities filings available at www.sedar.com. Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. American Lithium undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by applicable securities laws. Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  Cautionary Note Regarding Macusani ConcessionsThirty-two of the 169 concessions held by American Lithium\u2019s subsidiary Macusani, are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes (together, the \u201cProcesses\u201d) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared Macusani\u2019s title to 32 of the concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. In November 2019, Macusani applied for injunctive relief on 32 concessions in a Court in Lima, Peru and was successful in obtaining such an injunction on 17 of the concessions including three of the four concessions included in the Macusani Uranium Project PEA. The grant of the Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) has restored the title, rights and validity of those 17 concessions to Macusani until a final decision is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. A Precautionary Measure application was made at the same time for the remaining 15 concessions and was ultimately granted by a Court in Lima, Peru on March 2, 2021 which has also restored the title, rights and validity of those 15 remaining concessions to Macusani, with the result being that all 32 concessions are now protected by Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) until a final decision on this matter is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. The favourable judge\u2019s ruling confirming title to all 32 concessions from November 3, 2021 represents the final stage of the current judicial process. However, this ruling has recently been appealed by MINEM and INGEMMET. American Lithium has no assurance that the outcome of these appeals will be in the Company\u2019s favour.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll news about\u00a0AMERICAN LITHIUM CORP.\n\n\n\n\n06/07Sector Update: Energy Stocks Rising Late WednesdayMT\n\n06/07Sector Update: Energy Stocks Rising in Afternoon TradingMT\n\n06/07Sector Update: EnergyMT\n\n06/07American Lithium to Transfer Macusani Uranium Project's Ownership to Friday's Dog Holdi..MT\n\n06/07American Lithium Says Reached Definitive Agreement to Spin Out Macusani Uranium Deposit..MT\n\n06/07American Lithium Brief: Says Reached Definitive Agreement to Spin..MT\n\n06/07American Lithium Reaches Definitive Agreement to Spin Out\u00a0Macusani Uranium Deposit into..GL\n\n06/05American Lithium Announces Financial Highlights for Year Ended February 28, 2023 and Op..AQ\n\n06/02Surge Battery Metals Announces $7,160,000 Non-Brokered Private Placement Including a St..AQ\n\n06/02American Lithium Drops 1% in Premarket Trading as Its Fiscal Q4 Loss WidensMT\n\n\n\nMore news\n\n\n\n\nAnalyst Recommendations on\u00a0AMERICAN LITHIUM CORP.\n\n\n\n\n03/06American Lithium To Fast-Track Completion Of Pre-Feasibility Study For Falchani Project..MT\n\n03/01B.

(to be renamed, \u201cInternational Uranium Corp.\u201d) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV: FRDY | OTCQB: FDOGF) is pleased to announce that management of the Company, after review and consultation with its advisors, has determined it is in the best interests of shareholders of the Company to complete a business combination transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Lithium Corp. (TSX-V: LI | NASDAQ: AML | Frankfurt:5LA1) (\u201cAmerican Lithium\u201d). The Transaction will be completed by way of a court approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), pursuant to which, the Company will; acquire all of the outstanding securities of Macusani Uranium S.A.C. (\u201cMacusani Uranium\u201d), a wholly-owned Peruvian subsidiary of American Lithium incorporated on October 13, 2022; and change the business of the Company to uranium exploration and development as further outlined below. At the same time the Company will spin-out its existing business to existing shareholders of the Company (the \u201cShareholders\u201d) The Transaction, is subject to a number of closing conditions including: (i) the completion of a consolidation (the \u201cConsolidation\u201d) of the Company's outstanding share capital on the basis of one (1) post-Consolidation common share for every four-and-one-half (4.5) pre-Consolidation shares; (ii) the issuance to American Lithium of 80,000,000 post-Consolidation common shares (the \u201cConsideration Shares\u201d) in consideration of the issued and outstanding securities of Macusani Uranium; (iii) the completion of a concurrent brokered private placement of subscription receipts to raise gross proceeds of no less than $15,000,000 being coordinated by a syndicate lead by Eight Capital and National Bank Financial and including Canaccord Genuity Corp., Clarkson Securities AS and TD Securities (the \u201cConcurrent Offering\u201d); (iv) the completion of the spin-out of Friday's Dog Inc. (\u201cFDI\u201d), comprising the existing business of the Company, to the Shareholders; (v) the change of the Company's name to \u201cInternational Uranium Corp.\u201d; and (vi) the reconstitution of the current board of directors and management of the Company to consist of nominees of American Lithium (as further described below). The Macusani uranium property consists of 85 mineral concessions in Peru covering approximately 51,800 ha forming the Macusani uranium project, located on the Macusani Plateau, Puno, in southeastern Peru (the \u201cMacusani Project\u201d). The Macusani Project comprises one of world\u2019s largest undeveloped uranium projects with a large, at surface, resource and low-cost opex and capex profile as evidenced in its latest Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), available on American Lithium\u2019s website (www.americanlithiumcorp.com). The Macusani Project offers numerous additional opportunities for expansion and a flow-sheet that has the potential to deliver strong economic returns. Management of the Company believes the proposed transaction provides compelling benefits for the Company and its Shareholders. It focuses the Company as a pure-play uranium exploration and development company by spinning out its current unrelated business. The resulting issuer will focus on unlocking asset value by applying existing proceeds and funds raised in the subsequent offering to advance the Macusani Project by infill and expansion drilling and updating the existing PEA and resource. Jeremy Ross, Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated \u201cWe are delighted to be involved with the Macusani Project, which we believe is strategically positioned to capitalize on the growing global demand for nuclear energy and large, high-quality uranium deposits. With our robust financial resources and support from strategic investors, we have confidence in the project's ability to make a meaningful contribution to clean energy initiatives worldwide, while generating significant value for our existing Shareholders\u201d. American Lithium Arrangement Agreement In connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cAmerican Lithium Arrangement Agreement\u201d) with American Lithium, dated June 6, 2023, which sets out the proposed terms and conditions pursuant to which American Lithium and the Company will complete a business combination under a plan of arrangement in accordance with the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the \u201cAmerican Lithium Plan of Arrangement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the American Lithium Plan of Arrangement, American Lithium will complete an internal reorganization of its subsidiaries, such that following completion of the reorganization, Macusani Uranium will be a direct subsidiary of American Lithium; thereafter, the Company will issue to American Lithium the Consideration Shares in consideration of the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding securities of Macusani Uranium. Immediately following receipt of the Consideration Shares, American Lithium intends to distribute (the \u201cDistribution\u201d) the Consideration Shares to its existing common shareholders of record on a pro rata basis. In addition to the foregoing, the American Lithium Plan of Arrangement, is subject to a number of additional closing conditions including: (i) the approval of the shareholders of each of American Lithium and the Company; (ii) the approval of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (the \u201cCourt\u201d); (iii) the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \u201cTSXV\u201d) and all other applicable third party and regulatory consents for the Transaction; (iv) the Company having no less than CAD$5,000,000 in available cash of working capital prior to completion of the Concurrent Offering and after deducting the expenses associated with the Transaction; and (v) other customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature.\u00a0\u00a0 The issuance of the Consideration Shares and acquisition of Macusani Uranium will constitute a 'Reverse Takeover' and 'Change of Business' of the Company (as such terms are defined in TSXV Policy 5.2 \u2013 Change of Business and Reverse Takeovers) and accordingly, the Transaction is subject to and conditional on TSXV approval. Following completion of the Transaction, the Company (after the completion of the Transaction, the \u201cResulting Issuer\u201d) will have ownership and control over the Macusani Project. Management of the Resulting Issuer will be comprised of nominees of American Lithium, and American Lithium will arrange for the continuity of the existing development team in Peru. Macusani Uranium is currently wholly owned by Macusani Yellowcake S.A.S. (\u201cMacusani Yellowcake\u201d), a wholly owned Peruvian subsidiary of American Lithium, that currently holds title to 169 mineral concessions in Peru, including the Macusani Project concessions. In connection with the Transaction, Macusani Yellowcake has transferred the 85 concessions underlying the Macusani Project to Macusani Uranium and American Lithium will retain the right to participate in any future commercially viable discoveries of lithium mineralization on the Macusani Project concessions. The Company will be permitted to participate in any future commercially viable discoveries of uranium mineralization on the remaining Macusani Yellowcake mineral concessions which have been retained by American Lithium. Subject to TSXV approval, the common shares of the Resulting Issuer will trade on the TSXV under a new trading symbol to be determined by the parties. The Resulting Issuer is expected to be listed on Tier 2 of the TSXV as a mining issuer. In connection with the Transaction, trading in the common shares of the Company has been halted and is expected to remain halted until closing of the Transaction. The Company intends to rely on Section 2.11 of National Instrument 45-106 \u2013 Prospectus Exemptions, for an exemption from the prospectus requirements for the issuance of the Consideration Shares to American Lithium. Sponsorship of the Transaction is required by the TSXV unless exempt or waived in accordance with the policies of the TSXV. The Company intends to apply for a waiver from the sponsorship requirements. The Transaction is an arm\u2019s length transaction in accordance with the policies of the TSXV. The foregoing description is qualified by reference to the full text of the American Lithium Plan of Arrangement, set out at Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the American Lithium Arrangement Agreement, filed under the Company's profile on www.sedar.com Concurrent Brokered Offering  As a condition of closing of the American Lithium Plan of Arrangement, the Company intends to complete a best efforts brokered private placement of subscription receipts (\u201cSubscription Receipts\u201d) to be led by Eight Capital (the \u201cAgent\u201d) as co-lead agent and joint bookrunner together with National Bank Financial Inc., and with Canaccord Genuity Corp., Clarkson Securities AS and TD Securities as syndicate partners, at a price per Subscription Receipt of $0.50 (the \"Offered Securities\") to raise aggregate gross proceeds of $15,000,000. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Receipt Agreement, each Subscription Receipt will be convertible into one unit (each a \"Unit\") consisting of one common share of the Company and one-half of one common share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \u201cWarrant\u201d) entitling the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of $1.25 until 24 months from the closing date of the Concurrent Offering. The Company will pay the Agent a cash commission (\u201cAgent\u2019s Commission\u201d) equal to 6% of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Concurrent Offering (subject to a reduced commission for subscribers on an agreed upon president's list). The net proceeds of the Concurrent Offering, less 50% of the Agent\u2019s Commission, will be placed in escrow pending the satisfaction of the escrow release conditions of the Subscription Receipts including the completion of the Arrangements. Subject to closing of the satisfaction of the escrow release conditions and the release of the escrowed funds from escrow, the Agent will also receive that number of compensation warrants equal to 6% of the number of Offered Securities, other than Offered Securities purchased by purchasers on the president\u2019s list, with each such compensation warrant to be exercisable into one Unit at a price of $0.50 for a period of 24 months from closing of the Concurrent Offering (each a \"Compensation Unit Warrant\"). The Board contemplates using the net proceeds from the Concurrent Offering to fund the exploration and completion of a current preliminary economic assessment of the Macusani Project and for general corporate purposes. The Subscription Receipts, Warrants and common shares underlying the Warrants, Subscription Receipts, and Compensation Unit Warrants will be subject to a statutory four-month and one day hold period following closing of the Concurrent Offering and the policies of the TSXV. Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement In connection with the Transaction, the Company also entered into an additional arrangement agreement (the \u201cFriday\u2019s Dog Arrangement Agreement\u201d) with FDI (which currently controls the existing business of the Company) pursuant to which the Company will complete a spin-out of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDI (the \u201cFDI Shares\u201d) to the existing Shareholders on a 1 to 1 ratio under a plan of arrangement in accordance with the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the \u201cFriday's Dog Plan of Arrangement\u201d). Pursuant to the Friday's Dog Arrangement Agreement, and in accordance with the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement, the Company will complete the following steps (prior to effecting the Consolidation): the Company will alter its share capital to create the new common shares (the \u201cNew Common Shares\u201d).the Company will alter its authorized share structure to rename and re-designate all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Friday\u2019s Dog as Class A common shares without par value (the \u201cClass A Common Shares\u201d).Each Shareholder will transfer to the Company all of their Class A Common Shares and in exchange receive the following: One New Common Share at an exchange ratio of 1 to 1; andsuch number of FDI Shares as is equal to the pro-rata percentage ownership of Class A Common Shares of each Shareholder. The Company will alter its share capital so that only the New Common Shares will remain.Upon surrender of the Friday's Dog Shares, each Friday's Dog Share will be deemed after the closing of the Friday's Dog Arrangement to represent only the right to receive from the transfer agent, upon such surrender, such number of New Common Shares and FDI Shares that the Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement;Upon the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement becoming effective, FDI will cease to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and, as of the share distribution date, the Shareholders will hold all of the outstanding FDI Shares. In connection with the proposed American Lithium Plan of Arrangement and the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement (collectively the \u201cArrangements\u201d), the Shareholders will continue to own common shares of the Company subject to the completion of the Consolidation immediately following completion of the spin-out of the FDI Shares pursuant to the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement (the \u201cSpin-Out\u201d). The American Lithium Plan of Arrangement is conditional on the Spin-Out of FDI having been completed prior to closing. If either Arrangement does not receive all requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals the Transaction will not be completed. The foregoing description is qualified by reference to the full text of the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement, set out at Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Friday's Dog Arrangement Agreement, filed under the Company's profile on www.sedar.com. The Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement is subject to approval of the Court, the Friday's Dog Shareholders, and the TSXV, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained or that the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement will be completed on the terms contemplated, or at all. Further information regarding the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement is expected to be contained in a management information circular (the \u201cCircular\u201d) that the Company intends to prepare and mail to the Friday's Dog Shareholders in connection with the holding of an annual and special meeting (the \u201cMeeting\u201d) to approve the Transaction. Reasons for the Arrangement The Board is of the view that the Arrangements will benefit the Company and its Shareholders. This conclusion is based on the following primary determinations: By spinning out the existing FDI business consisting of canine care and grooming product manufacturing business, the Shareholders still retain their interest in the current business. Management believes that this business has a greater opportunity to be developed to its full potential realizable value as a separate reporting issuer not listed on an exchange which will help reduce operating costs and expenses for the current business as it continues to look for distributors for its products;The acquisition of Macusani Uranium pursuant to the American Lithium Plan of Arrangement will provide the Shareholders a direct interest in a new company with one of the largest undeveloped uranium projects whose ease of extraction and \u201cnear surface\u201d characteristics position it with the potential to be one of the lowest cost sources of uranium globally that will pursue the development of the Macusani Project as its sole initial priority. With mounting concerns around energy security and climate change, Macusani is strategically located in the Americas, and management believes it can play a large role in the transition to zero emission base-load electricity generation that the world requires;As a separate company, FDI will have direct access to public and private capital markets and will be able to raise equity to fund development of the existing FDI business on a priority basis;The Arrangements will create individual public reporting companies that are anticipated to result in separate and well-focused entities, each of which will provide a platform for transactions that management wishes to target; andFollowing closing of the Arrangements, FDI will be a \u201creporting issuer\u201d under securities legislation and accordingly, the Shareholders will continue to benefit from public company oversight from the securities commissions and the higher continuous disclosure, governance and financial statement requirements applicable to public companies, but no securities of FDI are expected to be listed on any regulated stock exchange upon closing of the Transaction. The securities to be issued under the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or applicable exemption from registration requirements. It is anticipated that any securities to be issued under the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement will be offered and issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. Meeting Details The Meeting date, time, and location is to be determined. A notice of meeting and record date will be available under its profile on www.sedar.com once finalized. Only Shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to vote at the Meeting. The Friday's Dog Arrangement is subject to Shareholder approval of not less than 66 2/3% of the votes cast at the Meeting and the approval of the American Lithium Arrangement Agreement is subject to Shareholder approval of not less than 51% of the votes cast at the Meeting. Interim and Final Order The Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement is subject to Court approval by way of receipt of an interim order (the \u201cInterim Order\u201d) and a final order (the \u201cFinal Order\u201d). The Interim Order will provide for, among other things, the holding of the Meeting to approve the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement. The Interim Order will also set out other conditions that must be met for the Company to apply for the Final Order of the Court to approve the Friday's Dog Plan of Arrangement.

Although the Company believe in light of the experience of its directors and officers, current conditions and expected future developments and other factors that have been considered appropriate and that the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on them because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Any such forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information. Actual results and developments may differ materially from those contemplated by these statements depending on, among other things, determination of acceptable terms for the proposed spinout transaction, risks and uncertainties relating to the receipt of approvals to proceed with and complete the Transaction and the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the Arrangements, unexpected tax consequences, the benefits of the spin-out transaction not being realized or as anticipated, the listing of the common shares of the Resulting Issuer on the TSXV, the timing and completion of the Concurrent Offering, and any and all future remedies pursued by American Lithium and its subsidiary Macusani Yellowcake to resolve the title for 32 of its concessions; the Company\u2019s strategic plans and the parties\u2019 ability to satisfy closing conditions and receive necessary approvals as planned. These statements should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those implied by such statements.

The Company assumes no responsibility to update or revise forward-looking information to reflect new events or circumstances unless required by applicable law. Cautionary Note Regarding Macusani Yellowcake Concessions Thirty-two of the 151 concessions held by American Lithium\u2019s subsidiary Macusani Yellowcake, are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes (together, the \u201cProcesses\u201d) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared Macusani\u2019s title to 32 of the concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. In November 2019, Macusani Yellowcake applied for injunctive relief on 32 concessions in a Court in Lima, Peru and was successful in obtaining such an injunction on 17 of the concessions including three of the four concessions included in the Macusani Uranium Project PEA. The grant of the Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) has restored the title, rights and validity of those 17 concessions to Macusani Yellowcake until a final decision is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. A Precautionary Measure application was made at the same time for the remaining 15 concessions and was ultimately granted by a Court in Lima, Peru on March 2, 2021 which has also restored the title, rights and validity of those 15 remaining concessions to Macusani Yellowcake, with the result being that all 32 concessions are now protected by Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) until a final decision on this matter is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. The favourable judge\u2019s ruling confirming title to all 32 concessions from November 3, 2021 represents the final stage of the current judicial process. However, this ruling has recently been appealed by MINEM and INGEMMET. American Lithium has no assurance that the outcome of these appeals will be in American Lithium's favour.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll news about\u00a0FRIDAY'S DOG HOLDINGS INC.\n\n\n\n\n06/07American Lithium Says Reached Definitive Agreement to Spin Out Macusani Uranium Deposit..MT\n\n06/07Friday's Dog Holdings Announces Plan of Arrangement to Become Major Uranium Developer a..GL\n\n06/06Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Trading Halt - FRDYAQ\n\n05/30Friday's Dog Holdings Inc.

Due to the high-risk fire conditions present in the region, coupled with ongoing fires elsewhere in the province, the ministry has mandated that all activities in the region\u2019s forests stop immediately, which includes mineral exploration, and that all personnel be evacuated from the territory affected. Therefore, following the notice, the Company has temporarily delayed its exploration activities in the region. The Company will continue to monitor the situation as it progresses. \u201cWe are sorry for this delay as we were getting ready to start our exploration campaign on the Mirabelli, Maqua, Pluton and Dalmas SM projects, but the safety of our teams takes precedence. We are monitoring the situation daily and will adjust accordingly so that exploration work resumes as soon as possible. We would also like to thank the team at SOPFEU and all local authorities who are dedicated to fighting forest fires in this beautiful region of Quebec.\u201d said Mr. Jonathan Hamel, Mosaic President and CEO. About Mosaic Minerals Corporation  Mosaic Minerals Corp. is a Canadian mining exploration company listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE: MOC) focusing on the exploration of minerals such as Nickel and Lithium in the province of Quebec. Source:M. Jonathan Hamel President & CEOjhamel@mosaicminerals.ca This release contains certain \u201cforward-looking information\u201d under applicable Canadian securities laws concerning the Arrangement. Forward-looking information reflects the Company\u2019s current internal expectations or beliefs and is based on information currently available to the Company. In some cases, forward-looking information can be identified by terminology such as \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cpotential\u201d, \u201cscheduled\u201d, \u201cforecast\u201d, \u201cbudget\u201d or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. Assumptions upon which such forward-looking information is based includes, among others, that the conditions to closing of the Arrangement will be satisfied and that the Arrangement will be completed on the terms set out in the definitive agreement. Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of the Company, and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct or accurate. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted herein include, without limitation: that the remaining conditions to the Arrangement will not be satisfied; that the business prospects and opportunities of the Company will not proceed as anticipated; changes in the global prices for gold or certain other commodities (such as diesel, aluminum and electricity); changes in U.S. dollar and other currency exchange rates, interest rates or gold lease rates; risks arising from holding derivative instruments; the level of liquidity and capital resources; access to capital markets, financing and interest rates; mining tax regimes; ability to successfully integrate acquired assets; legislative, political or economic developments in the jurisdictions in which the Company carries on business; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities; laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment; employee relations; availability and increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of exploration and development; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties; and the risks involved in the exploration, development and mining business. Risks and unknowns inherent in all projects include the inaccuracy of estimated reserves and resources, metallurgical recoveries, capital and operating costs of such projects, and the future prices for the relevant minerals.

(\"Amprius\" or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: AMPX), a leader in next-generation lithium-ion batteries with its Silicon Anode Platform, is set to join the broad-market Russell 3000\u00ae Index at the conclusion of the 2023 Russell indexes annual reconstitution, effective after the US market opens on June 26, according to a preliminary list of additions posted last month.\n\n\nAnnual Russell indexes reconstitution captures the 4,000 largest US stocks as of April 28, ranking them by total market capitalization. Membership in the US all-cap Russell 3000\u00ae Index, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion in the large-cap Russell 1000\u00ae Index or small-cap Russell 2000\u00ae Index as well as the appropriate growth and value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for its Russell indexes primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings, and style attributes.\n\n\n\u201cThe Russell Indexes are a well-respected and influential benchmarking standard, and our inclusion into the Russell 3000\u00ae Index represents a meaningful achievement for Amprius,\u201d said CEO Dr. Kang Sun. \u201cSince entering the public markets last September, we have continued delivering breakthrough products to customers and scaling our production capacity. We expect our inclusion in this select group to bring increased exposure to the broader investment community as we strive to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\u201d\n\n\nRussell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Approximately $12.1 trillion in assets are benchmarked against Russell\u2019s US indexes. Russell indexes are part of FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider.\n\n\nFor more information on the Russell 3000\u00ae Index and the Russell indexes reconstitution, please visit the \u201cRussell Reconstitution\u201d section on the FTSE Russell website.\n\n\nAbout Amprius Technologies, Inc.\n\nAmprius Technologies, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of high-energy and high-power lithium-ion batteries producing the industry\u2019s highest known energy density cells.

(\"Triple One\" or the \"Company\") (CSE:TONE) is a growth-oriented company headquartered in Windsor, Nova Scotia, Canada, acquiring critical metal and gold mineral assets in Eastern Canada. The Company is actively growing its specialized portfolio of lithium and precious metal assets. It also holds interests in value-added gold assets in Canada resulting from previous acquisitions in the precious metals space. The Company is pleased to report that it has completed its first phase of helicopter assisted prospecting and geochemical sampling at its Triple One Lithium property located north of the Town of Burgeo and southeast of the Kraken Lithium discovery pegmatite fields uncovered by the Alliance between of Benton Resources and Sokoman Minerals.\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding high winds along the south coast of Newfoundland, conditions for exploration were nearly ideal. The Burgeo Project consists of one mineral exploration licence (035633MM) containing 111 individual claims covering 2,775 hectares. The property is located approximately 17 kilometres north of the small town of Burgeo. The evolving deposit model examines radiating pegmatite dike swarms within the Burgeo and Chetwynd intrusive suites. The geology is building on key geological parameters associated with the Kraken lithium discovery made in 2021 by the Sokoman Minerals \u2013 Benton Resources 50/50 Strategic Alliance and is based on their large district-scale model. The Kraken discovery lies approximately 14 kilometres to the northwest of the Company\u2019s Triple One Project. A total of 35 sample were collected for whole rock and trace element geochemistry. The samples are currently undergoing preparation, with cutting, petrographic, and geochemical studies underway. The Company is looking forward to receiving analytical results from the property. Although not confirmed, Triple One is anticipating analytical results to be returned within 5-6 weeks. At Kraken and its surrounding projects, the Alliance continues to drill on their high-grade spodumene-bearing pegmatites where drill assays yield grades more than 1% Li2O with the dike swarms still open at depth and along strike. \u00a0\u00a0 Location of Triple One\u2019s Lithium Project relative to the Kraken and Hydra Li & Cs Discoveries by the Benton/Sokoman Alliance Please click here to view image Although analytical results have not yet been finalized, field identification suggest spodumene is present in east-west trending pegmatites. Mineralogical identification and geochemistry are ongoing. Subsequently planned exploration will include integrating geological, geochemical, and geophysical data acquisition. High -resolution drone photography, and soil and till geochemistry will also be carried out in the summer.\u00a0\u00a0 Much of the exploration work will, in part be helicopter supported. If the project proceeds to the drilling stage, then a mobile field camp may be established to help reduce daily commute times to and from the project site. \u00a0\u00a0 Company Chairman Bill Fleming stated, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the positive indication of spodumene on the property, but we caution more work is necessary\u201d. He further commented, \u201cThese are exciting times as Newfoundland emerges as a significant lithium district in the Appalachian Mountain Chain, especially given the first lithium and caesium discovers in the western Dunnage Zone by the Benton Resources \u2013 Sokoman Minerals 50/50 Strategic Alliance. We believe the presence of lithium close to our property opens a huge opportunity for us to add to our list of critical metal discoveries in the Province of Newfoundland\u201d. This mineral corridor, is in part defined by the Hermitage Flexure with its associated fault structures, may hold potential for the first major lithium \u00b1 cesium bearing ore deposit in Atlantic Canada. Exploration to date on the Burgeo Project shows both granite and pegmatite dike development to be far more abundance than initially expected.

(NYSE: PLTR) (\"Palantir\") and Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd., a Panasonic Group Company, a global leader in high-quality lithium-ion batteries, today announced a multi-year partnership to deliver an operations \"Smart Factory\" for the Panasonic Energy of North America (\"PENA\") facility in Sparks, Nevada. The company has selected Palantir's Foundry to help integrate edge sensors across factory lines, introduce automated efficiencies and enable operational users on factory floors to leverage connected operations. The agreement expands Palantir's signature platform including artificial intelligence and edge capabilities in the manufacturing space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriven by Foundry and informed by PENA's expertise, the \"Smart Factory\" will be utilized across the entirety of the information technology and operational organization within PENA. Using Foundry, the system will guide operational decision-making in their existing Nevada factory as well as the new facility in De Soto, Kansas starting in 2025. This strategic partnership is intended to provide the battery leader with the ability to quickly generate meaningful cost savings and increase return on investment once implemented.\n\"We engaged Palantir to assist on our journey towards a connected factory by addressing the challenges of disparate data systems and manual work arounds leading to inaccurate data analysis,\" said Justin Herman, Chief Information Officer of PENA. \"Within Foundry, we were able to operationalize our data and, within months, reduce waste throughout our manufacturing process. Over multiple use-cases across functional groups, Foundry is assisting in driving operational excellence for PENA, empowering our people through accurate data-driven decision making and delivering significant ROI per year. And we are just getting started.\"\nPENA previously relied on a combination of automated and manual processes, inspecting thousands of datapoints, and using ticketing systems to offer guidance on next steps. Now, with Foundry, PENA will be able to use AI/ML capabilities to increase uptime and decrease defects. Most of the manual processes of the past have been completely replaced by automated software with access to billions of data points across the entirety of the company.\n\"PENA is a leader in their field, and Foundry is the leading software to drive operational excellence for PENA,\" said Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar. \"Foundry now serves as the foundation of PENA's Smart Factory initiative, and we are already seeing meaningful impact on reducing material scrap and increasing line uptime, thereby improving the quality and volume of production outputs.\"\nAbout Palantir Technologies Inc.Foundational software of tomorrow.

Novonix also agreed to issue $30 million worth of unsecured notes to the Korean battery maker as the two sides look to build a strong partnership.The two companies will enter a separate purchase agreement if they successfully develop certain products under the initial contract. In this case, LG Energy Solution will be able to buy up to 50,000 metric tons of artificial graphite anode material over a 10-year period from the beginning of mass production.The latest collaboration comes as the Korean battery maker seeks to maximize the benefits it can get from the US administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act by expanding battery production and securing a reliable supply chain of battery materials in North America.According to the Korea International Trade Association, Chinese artificial graphite anode materials accounted for over 90 percent of the entire import by Korean companies last year. As the IRA shuns Chinese materials in battery supply chains, Korean companies such as LG Energy Solution have been searching for alternatives.\u201cOur partnership with Novonix once again demonstrates LG Energy Solution\u2019s determination to establish a solid battery supply chain in the US, complementing our local manufacturing network to meet our customer\u2019s needs for IRA-compliant batteries,\u201d said Kim Dong-soo, senior vice president of procurement center at LG Energy Solution.Novonix, which currently operates production sites in Tennessee, was selected for a $150 million grant by the US Department of Energy to support the Australian firm\u2019s expansion.\u201cWe are excited to formalize our work with LG Energy Solution and establish the path for Novovix to become a supplier for LGES of artificial graphite anode material in the United States,\u201d said Chris Burns, CEO of Novonix. \u201cThis agreement demonstrates our leading position to establish a supply chain for high-performance artificial graphite for the battery industry in North America.\u201dBy Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25c0 Back to List\nMore article by this Writer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n\n\n \nCan \u2018convenience\u2019 be healthier?\n\n\n\n\n \n14 injured by reversing subway escalator\n\n\n\n\n \nPride parade to take to Euljiro streets after Seoul Plaza refusal\n\n\n\n\n \nS.

Jindalee to commence a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) on the globally significant McDermitt Lithium ProjectMcDermitt is the largest Lithium deposit in the US by contained lithium with 21.5Mt Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) in Mineral Resource\u00b9Leading global EPC and maintenance company Fluor Corporation appointed as lead engineer for the PFSPositive industry developments and government support continue to bolster the outlook for the lithium sectorJindalee targeting December Quarter 2023 for completion of the PFS  Jindalee has appointed global engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) and maintenance company Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) (Fluor) as lead engineer for the PFS.McDermitt has an Inferred Mineral Resource Inventory of 3.0 Billion tonnes at 1,340ppm Li for total of 21.5 Million tonnes LCE at 1,000 ppm cut-off grade. At 21.5 Mt LCE, McDermitt is the largest Lithium deposit in the US by contained lithium in Mineral Resource, and a globally significant resource.Industry developmentsRecent industry developments in the US lithium sector include the commencement of construction at Lithium America\u2019s (TSX:LAC) nearby Thacker Pass Project2, which is supported by a US$650M equity investment and exclusive offtake by US car manufacturer General Motors Company (GM)\u00b3 and the US Department of Energy (DOE) announcement of a conditional loan of up to US$700M to support development of Ioneer Limited\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge Lithium\u2010Boron Project in Esmerelda County, Nevada4.These developments have provided the Board of Jindalee with increased confidence in the prospects for development of McDermitt to feed the United States\u2019 rapidly growing demand for domestically produced lithium.This demand has been catalysed in no small way by the passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act 2022 (IRA), which provides US$369B in funding to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. Under the IRA at least 40% of an EV\u2019s battery materials must be sourced from the US (or a Free Trade Agreement partner) to qualify for an EV tax credit, rising to 80% by 2027. Furthermore, miners producing critical materials will be eligible for tax credits equivalent to 10% of production costs and US$40B has been made available under the DOE\u2019s Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee to support projects that bolster a domestic supply of critical minerals.Jindalee also notes the recent conclusion of the Australia-United States Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact5, which aims to establish climate and clean energy as a central pillar of the Australia-United States Alliance. Among the objectives of the Compact is the promotion of a responsible, sustainable and stable supply of critical minerals essential to the global energy transformation. While operationalisation of the Compact is at an early stage, its signing is considered by the Board to be positive for companies whose operations and interests span the two countries, such as Jindalee.Completion of a PFS represents the next logical step towards development of McDermitt and is expected to facilitate meaningful discussions with potential financiers (both public and private sector), offtakers and strategic partners.Current status and expected timetable for PFS workOn 24 March 2023 Jindalee announced that Fluor had completed a review of all metallurgical testwork undertaken by Jindalee in relation to McDermitt6. The review determined that acid leaching with beneficiation (to upgrade the leach head grade) delivered the lowest operating costs and best financial outcome among the alternatives considered, and noted that the very large Mineral Resource at McDermitt (21.5 Mt LCE, Table 1)* allows flexibility in development, providing the opportunity to optimise mining and feed high grade ore early in the mine life.Fluor recommended that further testwork be undertaken to refine the preferred flowsheet for the processing of McDermitt ore. Sample selection for this testwork has since commenced under the supervision of Fluor. In addition, Jindalee has commenced further studies which will feed into the PFS, including detailed geological modelling and geochemical domaining of the McDermitt deposit, together with preliminary pit optimisations and mining studies.The PFS, which will generate a capital and operating cost estimate to an accuracy of +/-25% to 35%, is expected to be completed during the December Quarter 2023.Jindalee\u2019s Chairman Justin Mannolini commented: \u201cI am delighted to announce the appointment of Fluor as lead engineer for the McDermitt PFS. McDermitt is a very large and potentially strategically important domestic source of lithium for the US battery industry. Fluor has assembled a team of highly credentialled engineers and metallurgists with extensive experience with US sediment hosted lithium deposits to work on the PFS, which we look forward to completing in late 2023.\u201dClick here for the full ASX ReleaseThis article includes content from Jindalee Resources Limited, licensed for the purpose of publishing on Investing News Australia.

Standard Lithium is a leading near-commercial lithium development company with a portfolio of projects in process. The Company\u2019s flagship projects, the Lanxess Project and the South West Arkansas Project, are located in Southern Arkansas near the Louisiana state line. The Company is focused on the evaluation and testing of commercial lithium extraction and purification from brine sourced from approximately 180,000 acres of unitized leases across these two projects. The Company operates a first-of-a-kind industrial-scale Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) Demonstration Plant at the Lanxess Project. The scalable, environmentally friendly process eliminates the use of evaporation ponds, reduces processing time from months to hours and greatly increases the effective recovery of lithium. A Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) and Front-End Engineering Study (FEED) for Phase 1A of the Lanxess Project commenced in September 2022. A Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) of the South West Arkansas Project commenced in May 2022. The Company is also pursuing the resource development of other projects in the Smackover Formation in East Texas, as well as approximately 45,000 acres of mineral leases located in the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California.

Desplechin\u2019s film, meanwhile, we expect to be overwhelming, roundly excellent, and incapable of receiving U.S. distribution.\nWhile we wait, our French-speaking readers can enjoy a recent talk between Carax and Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who just wrapped his Serpent\u2019s Path remake:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Arnaud DesplechinC'est pas moiLeos CaraxSpectateursNick NewmanManaging EditorNick lives in New York with his cats Drenka and Telemachus.

Atlas Lithium, formerly known as Brazil Minerals, is a mineral exploration and development company with lithium projects and exploration properties in other critical and battery minerals, including nickel, rare earths, graphite, and titanium.\n\n\nFor more information, submit a form, email Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call (800) 350-6003.\n\n\nWhat is this Case About: Atlas Lithium Corporation (ATLX) Misled Investors Regarding its Mining Capabilities and Conducted Deceptive Promotions to Inflate the Company's Stock\n\n\nAccording to the complaint, throughout the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) the Company overstated the success of its lithium mining and misrepresented the nature of its Brazilian mineral rights; (ii) in connection with these misrepresentations, Atlas Lithium conducted deceptive promotions to artificially inflate the value of the Company\u2019s stock; (iii) the foregoing conduct was designed to allow CEO Fogassa and other Company insiders to sell shares back into the market for a profit before the true nature of Atlas Lithium\u2019s business was revealed; and (iv) as a result, Defendants\u2019 public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.\n\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Bleecker Street Research published a report entitled \"Atlas Lithium (ATLX): First Comes The Pump \u2026 Now Here Comes the Dump.\" The report described Atlas Lithium as a \u201cpretender\u201d and stated that \u201cit resembles many of the characteristics of a pump and dump.\u201d The report alleged that Atlas Lithium\u2019s \u201cpredecessor company did a similar promotion before bagging retail investors\u201d; that \u201cAtlas Lithium\u2019s CEO was previously associated with Hunter Wise Securities, a broker fined $105 million for claiming to sell physical gold that it didn\u2019t have\u201d; and that \u201c[EF Hutton, a] similarly disastrous bank[,] handled ATLX\u2019s most recent offering and uplisting in early January.\u201d On this news, Atlas Lithium\u2019s stock price fell $12.95 per share, or 43.34%, to close at $16.93 per share on May 4, 2023.\n\n\nWhat Now: Similarly situated shareholders may be eligible to participate in the class action against Atlas Lithium Corporation.

 No Offer or Solicitation Regarding Securities\n        \n\n          This presentation has been prepared by Sigma Lithium Corporation (\"Sigma\") for general information purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of Sigma or its affiliates in any jurisdiction, including but not limited to Canada and the United States. The contents of this presentation should not be interpreted as financial, investment, tax, legal, or accounting advice. Readers should consult their own advisors.\n        \n\n          The contents of this presentation have not been approved or disapproved by any securities commission or regulatory authority in United States or Canada or any other jurisdiction, and Sigma expressly disclaims any responsibility to make disclosures or any filings with any securities commission or regulatory authority, beyond that imposed by applicable laws.\n        \n\n          Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n        \n\n          This presentation contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable United States securities laws (collectively referred to herein as \"Forward Looking Information\"). All such Forward Looking Information is made under the provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, may be Forward Looking Information, including, but not limited to, mineral resource or mineral reserve estimates (which reflect a prediction of mineralization that would be realized by development). When used in this presentation, such statements generally use words such as \"may\", \"would\", \"could\", \"will\", \"intend\", \"expect\", \"believe\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"estimate\" and other similar terminology. These statements reflect management's current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date such statements were made. Forward Looking Information involves significant risks and uncertainties, should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results, and does not necessarily provide accurate indications of whether or not such results will be achieved. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the Forward-Looking Information, which is based upon what management believes are reasonable assumptions, and there can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with the Forward-Looking Information.\n        \n\n          In particular (but without limitation), this presentation contains Forward Looking Information with respect to the following matters: the lithium sector and long-term outlook thereof; the growth of European electric vehicle (\"EV\") demand; anticipated trends relating to lithium structural supply tightness; development, construction and large scale production at Sigma's Grota do Cirilo Lithium Project (the \"Project\") and the phases and timing thereof; sustainability and environmental initiatives and the continued success thereof; processing production costs and other cost estimates; the quality and grades of lithium concentrates; publishing of additional pre-feasibility and feasibility studies; expansion of mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Project; intentions to fund construction using debt from commercial and development banks; anticipated start-up costs at the Project; relationships with engineering and construction companies; anticipated risk mitigation and execution plans; the adherence by Sigma to global environmental guidance; and economic performance, financial projections and requirements, and other expectations of Sigma. In addition, documents referred to in this presentation and filed publicly by Sigma may contain further Forward-Looking Information with respect to the following matters: anticipated decision making with respect to the Project; capital expenditure programs; estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves; development of mineral resources and mineral reserves; government regulation of mining operations and treatment under governmental and taxation regimes; the future price of commodities, including lithium; the realization of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, including whether mineral resources will ever be developed into mineral reserves; the timing and amount of future production; entering into binding offtake arrangements; currency exchange and interest rates; expected outcome and timing of environmental surveys and permit applications and other environmental matters; Sigma's ability to raise capital and obtain project financing; expected expenditures to be made by Sigma on its properties; successful operations and the timing, cost, quantity, capacity and quality of production; capital costs, operating costs and sustaining capital requirements, including the cost of construction of the processing plant for the Project; competitive conditions and anticipated trends post-COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing uncertainties and effects in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n        \n\n          Forward Looking Information does not take into account the effect of transactions or other items announced or occurring after the statements are made. Forward Looking Information is based upon a number of expectations and assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Sigma's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those disclosed in or implied by such Forward Looking Information. With respect to the Forward Looking Information, Sigma has made assumptions regarding, among other things: General economic and political conditions; Stable and supportive legislative, regulatory and community environment in the jurisdictions where Sigma operates; Stability and inflation of the Brazilian Real, including any foreign exchange or capital controls which may be enacted in respect thereof, and the effect of current or any additional regulations on Sigma's operations; Anticipated trends and effects in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic; Demand for lithium, including that such demand is supported by growth in the EV market; Estimates of, and changes to, the market prices for lithium; The impact of increasing competition in the lithium business and Sigma's competitive position in the industry; Sigma's market position and future financial and operating performance; Sigma's estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves, including whether mineral resources will ever be developed into mineral reserves; Anticipated timing and results of exploration, development and construction activities; Reliability of technical data; Sigma's ability to develop and achieve production at the Project; Sigma's ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms to develop the Project; Sigma's ability to obtain and maintain mining, exploration, environmental and other permits, authorizations and approvals for the Project; The timing and possible outcome of regulatory and permitting matters for the Project; The exploration, development, construction and operational costs for the Project; The accuracy of budget, construction and operations estimates for the Project; Successful negotiation of definitive commercial agreements, including off-take agreements for the Project; Sigma's ability to operate in a safe and effective manner.\n        \n\n          Although management believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such Forward-Looking Information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that these assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. Since Forward Looking Information inherently involves risks and uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such information. Sigma's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any Forward-Looking Information as a result of various known and unknown risk factors, including (but not limited to) the risk factors referred to under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the most recent amended and restated annual information form of Sigma. Such risks relate to, but are not limited to, the following: Sigma may not develop the Project into a commercial mining operation; There can be no assurance that market prices for lithium will remain at current levels or that such prices will improve; The market for EVs and other large format batteries currently has limited market share and no assurances can be given for the rate at which this market will develop, if at all, which could affect the success of Sigma and its ability to develop lithium operations; Changes in technology or other developments could result in preferences for substitute products; New production of lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate from current or new competitors in the lithium markets could adversely affect prices; The Project is at development stage and Sigma's ability to succeed in progressing through development to commercial operations will depend on a number of factors, some of which may be outside its control; Sigma's financial condition, operations and results of any future operations are subject to political, economic, social, regulatory and geographic risks of doing business in Brazil; Violations of anti-corruption,anti-bribery,anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations could materially adversely affect Sigma's business, reputation, results of any future operations and financial condition; Sigma is subject to regulatory frameworks applicable to the Brazilian mining industry which could be subject to further change, as well as government approval and permitting requirements, which may result in limitations on Sigma's business and activities; Sigma's operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and expose Sigma to environmental compliance risks, which may result in significant costs and have the potential to reduce the profitability of operations; Physical climate change events and the trend toward more stringent regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change could have an adverse effect on Sigma's business and future operations; As Sigma does not have any experience in the construction and operation of a mine, processing plants and related infrastructure, it is more difficult to evaluate Sigma's prospects, and Sigma's future success is more uncertain than if it had a more proven history of developing a mine; Sigma's future production estimates are based on existing mine plans and other assumptions which change from time to time. No assurance can be given that such estimates will be achieved; Sigma may experience unexpected costs and cost overruns, problems and delays during construction, development, mine start-up and operations for reasons outside of Sigma's control, which have the potential to materially affect its ability to fully fund required expenditures and/or production or, alternatively, may require Sigma to consider less attractive financing solutions; Sigma's capital and operating cost estimates may vary from actual costs and revenues for reasons outside of Sigma's control; Sigma's operations are subject to the high degree of risk normally incidental to the exploration for, and the development and operation of, mineral properties; Insurance may not be available to insure against all such risks, or the costs of such insurance may be uneconomic. Losses from uninsured and underinsured losses have the potential to materially affect Sigma's financial position and prospects; Sigma is subject to risks associated with securing title and property interests; Sigma is subject to strong competition in Brazil and in the global mining industry; Sigma may become subject to government orders, investigations, inquiries or other proceedings (including civil claims) relating to health and safety matters, which could result in consequences material to its business and operations; Sigma's mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates are estimates only and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery of minerals will in fact be realized or that identified mineral resources or mineral reserves will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) deposit; Sigma's operations and the development of its projects may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain positive community relations; Sigma is exposed to risks associated with doing business with counterparties, which may impact Sigma's operations and financial condition; Any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between Sigma and Sigma's subsidiaries, or among such entities, could restrict Sigma's ability to fund its operations efficiently; Sigma is subject to risks associated with its reliance on consultants and others for mineral exploration and exploitation expertise; The current COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on Sigma's business, operations, financial condition and stock price; If Sigma is unable to ultimately generate sufficient revenues to become profitable and have positive cash flows, it could have a material adverse effect on its prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations or overall viability as an operating business (\u2026)\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                High Purity Lithium, Responsibly Sourced\n              \n\n\n\n                page 2\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Disclaimer\n        \n\n          (\u2026) Sigma is subject to liquidity risk and therefore may have to include a \"going concern\" note in its financial statements; Sigma may not be able to obtain sufficient financing in the future on acceptable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on Sigma's business, results of operations and financial condition. In order to obtain additional financing, Sigma may conduct additional (and possibly dilutive) equity offerings or debt issuances in the future; Sigma may be unable to achieve cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit it to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on Sigma's indebtedness, or maintain its debt covenants; Sigma has not declared or paid dividends in the past and may not declare or pay dividends in the future; Sigma will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company both in Canada listed on the TSXV and in the United States listed on Nasdaq, and its management will be required to devote further substantial time to United States public company compliance efforts; If Sigma does not maintain adequate and appropriate internal controls over financial reporting as outlined in accordance with National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings or the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), Sigma will have to report a material weakness and disclose that Sigma has not maintained appropriate internal controls over financial reporting; As a foreign private issuer, Sigma is subject to different U.S. securities laws and rules than a domestic U.S. issuer, which may limit the information publicly available to its shareholders; Failure to retain key officers, consultants and employees or to attract and, if attracted, retain additional key individuals with necessary skills could have a materially adverse impact upon Sigma's success; Sigma is subject to currency fluctuation risks; From time to time, Sigma may become involved in litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and prospects; Certain directors and officers of Sigma are, or may become, associated with other natural resource companies which may give rise to conflicts of interest; The market price for Sigma's shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors beyond its control, and Sigma may be subject to securities litigation as a result; If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about Sigma's business, or if they downgrade the common shares of Sigma (the \"Common Shares\"), the price of the Common Shares could decline; Sigma will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from offerings of its securities; There is no guarantee that the Common Shares will earn any positive return in the short term or long term; Sigma has a major shareholder which owns 47.7% of the outstanding Common Shares and, as such, for as long as such shareholder directly or indirectly maintains a significant interest in Sigma, it may be in a position to affect Sigma's governance, operations and the market price of the Common Shares; As Sigma is a Canadian corporation but most of its directors and officers are not citizens or residents of Canada or the U.S., it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to enforce judgements against Sigma and its directors and officers outside of Canada and the U.S. which may have been obtained in Canadian or U.S. courts or initiate court action outside Canada or the U.S. against Sigma and its directors and officers in respect of an alleged breach of securities laws or otherwise. Similarly, it may be difficult for U.S. shareholders to effect service on Sigma to realize on judgments obtained in the United States; Sigma is governed by the corporate and securities laws of the Province of Ontario and of Canada, which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than U.S. corporate laws and U.S. securities laws; Sigma is subject to risks associated with its information technology systems and cyber-security; Sigma may be a Passive Foreign Investment Company, which may result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. holders of Common Shares.\n        \n\n          Readers are cautioned that the foregoing lists of assumptions and risks is not exhaustive. The Forward-Looking Information contained in this presentation is expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All Forward Looking Information in this presentation speaks as of the date of such statements were made, as applicable. Sigma does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any Forward-Looking Information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities law. Additional information about these assumptions, risks and uncertainties is contained in Sigma's filings with securities regulators, including Sigma's then-current annual information form, which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.\n        \n\n          Cautionary Note Regarding Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates\n        \n\n          Technical disclosure regarding Sigma's properties included in this presentation has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of U.S. securities laws. Without limiting the foregoing, such technical disclosure uses terms that comply with reporting standards in Canada and estimates are made in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). Unless otherwise indicated, all mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates contained in the technical disclosure have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (the \"CIM Definition Standards\").\n        \n\n          Under the SEC rules regarding disclosure of technical information, the definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" are substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards, and the SEC recognizes \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" which are also substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards. However, there are still differences in the definitions and standards under the SEC rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Therefore, Sigma's mineral resources and reserves as determined in accordance with NI 43-101 may be significantly different than if they had been determined in accordance with the SEC rules.\n        \n\n          Third Party Information\n        \n\n          This presentation includes market, industry, economic data and projections which was obtained from various publicly available sources and other sources believed by Sigma to be true. Although Sigma believes it to be reliable, it has not independently verified any of the data from third party sources referred to in this presentation or analyzed or verified the underlying reports relied upon or referred to by such sources, or ascertained the underlying economic and other assumptions relied upon by such sources. Sigma believes that the market, industry and economic data is accurate and that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness thereof. The accuracy and completeness of the market, industry and economic data in this presentation are not guaranteed, and Sigma does not make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such information.\n        \n\n          Technical Information\n        \n\n          Wes Roberts, P.Eng., a member of the technical committee of Sigma, is the \"qualified person\" under NI 43-101 who reviewed and approved the technical information disclosed in this presentation.\n        \n\n          Certain technical information in this presentation was derived from the technical report dated January 16, 2023, with an effective date of October 31, 2022, titled \"Grota do Cirilo Lithium Project, Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed and Itinga Regions, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Updated Technical Report\" and prepared by Homero Delboni Jr, B.E., M.Eng.Sc., Ph.D., Marc-Antoine Laporte, P. Geo, Jarrett Quinn, P.Eng., Porifrio Cabaleiro Rodriguez, MEng., and Noel O'Brien, B.E., MBA, F AusIMM (the \"Updated Technical Report\"). The Updated Technical Report is available on the SEDAR profile of Sigma at www.sedar.com. Mineral resources in the Updated Technical Report are reported inclusive of mineral reserves. Readers are advised that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Some figures herein have been rounded for presentation purposes. It is noted that Sigma has not yet made a production decision in respect of the Barreiro deposit. Sigma expects that it will assess the results of a definitive feasibility study before making a production decision in respect of the Barreiro deposit. All statements regarding mine development or production in respect of the Barreiro deposit in this presentation are expressly qualified by this statement.\n        \n\n          Non-GAAP Measures\n        \n\n          This presentation and the Updated Feasibility Study Report contain certain non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning within IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

Its leadership is more than familiar with the many challenges of mining in the north establishing and maintaining strong relationships with both provincial governments and community leaders.These community connections alongside North Arrow's expertise have already served it well. It has, thus far, established three major lithium projects in the North \u2014 DeStaffanay, Baffin Island and Bathurst Inlet.Of these, DeStaffanay is the company's flagship and the resource with the greatest potential to rapidly bring spodumene lithium to market. Successfully staked at a significantly lower cost than its counterparts, the project hosts some incredibly promising lithium mineralization. It also has the benefit of being located on the shoreline of Great Slave Lake, ensuring easy access via barge, while old spodumene exposures, due to historical mining efforts, streamline both drilling and sample collection.\n            \n                Company Highlights\n            \n            \n        Lithium demand is rapidly outpacing supply, with a hard cap predicted as early as 2027.The market will reward any company that can bring spodumene lithium quickly to market.A junior mining and exploration company based primarily in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories and Nunavut, North Arrow Minerals has the potential to do precisely this.Its flagship project, DeStaffanay, was recently financed, and the company has plans to start an exploration program here in the very near term.North Arrow maintains two other promising lithium projects, both situated in Northern Canada.Through decades of experience, North Arrow's leadership has built strong relationships in the NWT and Nunavut. The company is a two-time winner of the Nunavut Mining Symposium Corporate Award, recognizing its contribution to the economic/social development of Nunavut.Strong relationships with governments and community leaders in the North.North Arrow\u2019s management and directors have a successful track record of resource discovery and development in Canada\u2019s North, with at least two discoveries going on to become successful mines.The company recently announced a successful non-brokered private placement financing run of $2 million.The company also maintains a strategic partnership with Panarc Resources, the goal of which is to identify additional spodumene targets in the NWT and Nunavut.This North Arrow Minerals profile is part of a paid investor education campaign.*Click here to connect with North Arrow Minerals (TSXV:NAR) to receive an Investor PresentationLithium InvestingNorth Arrow Mineralstsxv stockstsxv:narNAR:CCThe Conversation (0)Investing News Network05 June\n        North Arrow Minerals\n    Keep reading...Show lessInvesting News Network01 June\n        North Arrow Minerals Grants Stock Options\n    North Arrow Minerals Inc.

fields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  By Robb M. Stewart \n\n\n  The spread of forest fires across eastern Canada and the evacuation of communities in coastal Quebec are continuing to disrupt resources companies and to force their operations to be suspended. \n\n  Exploration company Norris Lithium said Tuesday it has temporarily halted activities at its Highway and Bus lithium properties in the western James Bay region of Quebec after the provincial government issued an emergency order due to the heightened threat of fires. \n\n  The central province of Saskatchewan is also dealing with major forest fires, causing Brunswick Exploration to suspend exploration activities across three camps in the Eeyou Istchee-James Bay region after the government extended its ban on access to large areas of land and closed roads to help combat fires. \n\n  Brunswick Exploration said operations would remain suspended until it can properly assess the situation, but it would continue to work at other operations in the Montreal-based mineral exploration company's portfolio. \n\n  Champion Electric Metals has similarly temporarily ceased field activities in the James Bay area, but it said people would return to the field as soon as it is deemed safe. \n\n  The federal government has warned Canada could see the largest area of the country hit by fires if the unprecedented pace seen early in the wildfire season continues. According to the Canadian government, 413 active fires were blazing from coast to coast as of Sunday, and roughly 26,206 people are currently under an evacuation order. \n\n  So far this year, Ottawa estimates  2,214 fires nationally have burned about 3.3 million hectares, which compares with a 10-year average over the same timeframe of 1,624 fires and 254,429 hectares burned. \n\n\n  Write to Robb M.

on Tuesday said it continues to progress projects towards producing battery-grade \"green\" lithium, including the completion of several new wells, and \"remains in positive dialogue\" with the Chilean government regarding new state participation requirements.\n\nIn late April, the Chile-focused sustainable lithium exploration and development company said it welcomed government proposals concerning the nationalisation of Chile's lithium industry, saying these focused more on \"partnership\" than nationalisation.\n\nOn Tuesday the company said Marcela Hernando, Chile's minister of Mining, has clarified that Santiago will only seek state control of projects considered \"strategic\", which does not apply to CleanTech Lithium. It confirmed that its projects are not subject to state participation requirements. \n\nCleanTech Lithium said new wells at LV05 and LV06 have been completed at the Laguna Verde project. At LV05 it collected 62 samples with an average lithium grade of 202 milligrams per litre, along with 53 samples at LV06 with an average grade of 174 mg/l.\n\nAt its Francisco Basin project, CleanTech Lithium said it had completed all three new wells planned for its drilling campaign this year. Two extra wells have been added to the programme to further test the extension of the resource. \n\nCleanTech Lithium also said that at the Llamara project a hole shut-in was needed at exploration drill hole LL01 for safety reasons, after porous sandstone was encountered and recorded brine and a gas sequence. The brine was at a shallower depth than expected, which the company said is a \"positive sign\". A second exploration drill hole, LL02, was recently started following an evaluation of seismic data. \n\nThe company said it expects to commence a field programme, sampling the surface evaporite deposit at Llamara, during the third quarter of this year. \n\n\"CleanTech Lithium continues to make significant progress on the ground across all three of our projects, with drilling campaigns running simultaneously and delivering results and valuable insights to inform our path to production,\" commented Chief Executive Officer Aldo Boitano.\n\n\"We continue to have very positive discussions with the government and state entities regarding the development of our projects and will provide further updates on progress in the coming weeks.\"\n\nShares in CleanTech Lithium were down 4.6% at 46.75 pence in London on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBy Emma Curzon, Alliance News reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

And by naughty, I of course mean negligently murderous. There\u2019s just something about that level of disdain for the lives of your customers that just gives a girl pause on ever trusting a company again. I come from a Stellantis family anyway, which is another brand I won\u2019t ever buy for entirely different reasons. AdvertisementNot that Volkswagen ownership has been a breeze either. The engine is sound, but a new electronic gremlin pops up every few months. This is not unexpected of course, but more annoying than I initially thought. Currently my onboard is telling me all four tires are flat and my backup camera doesn\u2019t work. Terrific stuff VW (or should I say Bosch?) But I\u2019d still take my glitchy cheater diesel over a deadly econo-car any day of the week. What about you? What car brand will you never own again, either on principle or an intensely bad ownership experience or maybe because you\u2019re punishing the company over a really annoying car ad? You know how this works. See you below. Show all 178 comments"

You can also reach us through the firm's website at www.schallfirm.com, or by email at bschall@schallfirm.com.\n\n\nThe class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.\n\n\nAccording to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Atlas Lithium overinflated its mixing success while making vague statements about its mineral rights in Brazil. The Company deceptively promoted itself to inflate its stock price. The Company\u2019s self-promotion was designed to allow insiders and executives to sell off their positions. Based on these facts, the Company\u2019s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Atlas Lithium, investors suffered damages.\n\n\nJoin the case to recover your losses.\n\n\nThe Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.\n\n\nThis press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and rules of ethics.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230606005549/en/\n \u00a9 Business Wire 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll news about\u00a0ATLAS LITHIUM CORPORATION\n\n\n\n\n05:46aAtlx Lawsuit Alert : Levi & Korsinsky Notifies Atlas Lithium Corporation Investors of a Cl..PR\n\n06/07Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Notifies Atlas Lithium Corp.

(\u201cGold Lion\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (CSE: GL) (OTC: GLIOF) (FWB: 2BC) is pleased to announce that it has finalized arrangements to commence its 2023 exploration program (Phase 1) at the Mia-3 Lithium Project located in Eeyou Istchee, James Bay, Quebec. The Phase 1 program is planned to commence June 20 and will include surface mapping, prospecting, and rock sampling to test for lithium mineralization and lithium-cesium-tantalum (LCT) characteristics in pegmatites that may be located across the property. \u201cGold Lion are very excited to commence our inaugural field exploration program on the Mia-3 Lithium project, with the main objective being to identify drill targets through rock sampling and surface mapping. There are other companies also actively exploring a nearby lithium trend, which has already identified many occurrences of high-grade spodumene pegmatites,\u201d said Mark Haywood, CEO of the Company. Geologica Groupe-Conseil Inc. (\u201cGeologica\u201d) have been engaged to perform the Phase 1 field examination work following on from the compelling targets identified by the Company\u2019s compilation of the Quebec Government and mineral sector historic exploration work. The field examination is planned for 10 days of helicopter supported exploration, designed to cover the complete 57 claim Mia-3 project. The Mia-3 project is located 14 km to the northwest of the Miakadow Lake lithium pegmatite occurrence (now named Mia-1). Both are within the within the La Grande geological sub-province. These pegmatites were documented in 1991 by Noranda Exploration while exploring for gold and base metals. Later exploration in the Miakadow Lake area by Ressources Dianor Inc. (1999) describes a felsic pluton and a series of coarsely pegmatitic dykes related to the Vieux-Comptoir granites which intrude the La Grande and are seen along the south and south-west shores of Miakadow Lake. The Vieux Comptoir granitic rocks intrude multiple lithologies in the La Grande sub province and are a key exploration vector which Gold Lion will investigate during this initial field program. Geologica recently completed a property Technical Report dated May 5, 2023, \u201cNI 43-101 Technical Evaluation Report of the Mia Li-3 Lithium Project.\u201d The report is filed under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR. Geologica will be updating this report with results from their site visit as well as providing the first full coverage map for the property from new information. About Gold Lion Resources Inc. Gold Lion Resources Inc. is a mineral exploration company actively involved in the exploration of the Mia-3 Lithium Property located in the James Bay region of Quebec.

2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Oz Lithium Corporation (CSE: OZLI)\u00a0(OTC: GRXXF) (Frankfurt: G0A). Oz Lithium is pleased to announce that it has submitted an Environmental Impact Report to initiate a complete study of the Laguna Santa Mar\u00eda Soda Ash Mine. The property will undergo a detailed environmental assessment as part of the company's commitment to responsible mining practices. Oz Lithium is also meeting with authorities from Tolar Grande, the nearest town to the Laguna Santa Maria Mine, to discuss the study and introduce the Company. \u00a0\nTo support this effort, Oz Lithium has engaged Geo Brand, a Salta-based company with extensive experience in environmental assessments, to conduct a VES (Vertical Electrical Sounding) survey. The VES survey will be conducted by Geo Brand, and it will involve the distribution of 15 electrode points every 500 meters, creating a total of 8 transects in the area. Four of these transects will run in a northeast to southeast direction, and the other four will run in a northwest to southwest direction. This approach provides a better subsurface representation of the area and will provide valuable information for the study.\nIn addition to the VES survey, Oz Lithium's team will be conducting a sampling program designed to capture a representative subsurface characterization of the area. The sampling program will involve the excavation of shallow pits up to three meters deep, creating a grid that will allow for the collection of 15 samples. Industry best practices will be employed in the program. Work is proceeding under the supervision of Mr. William Feyerabend, a Qualified Person (QP), in accordance with National Instrument 43-101.\nSoda ash is an important reagent in the production of lithium carbonate with the process requiring two tonnes of soda ash for every tonne of lithium carbonate produced. As reported in La Nacion (Argentina News) January 30, 2023, insufficient local supply and importing issues are challenges for present and future lithium carbonate producers in Argentina. Management believes a first mover advance exists for the Company with the Laguna Santa Maria Project. Much of the current sodium bicarbonate production in Argentina is required by the glass industry. Lithium carbonate producers must import their requirements of sodium bicarbonate from the world market. The potential demand for soda ash is significant given the expanding lithium production industry in Argentina. The location of the project in close proximity to lithium project development may provide a significant freight advantage.\n\"We are committed to responsible mining practices, and this study is an essential step in ensuring that we meet our environmental obligations,\" shares Oz Lithium CEO, Mr. Adrian Hobkirk. \"We look forward to sharing the results with the community and our stakeholders.\"\nMr. William Feyerabend,\u00a0CPG,\u00a0a Consulting Geologist and a Qualified Person under NI 43-101, participated in the production of this news release and approves the technical and scientific content.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\nAdrian Hobkirk\u00a0President and CEO\nT: 954-684-8040E: info@ozlithiumcorp.com \u00a0W: www.ozlithiumcorp.com\nThe CSE has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this news release.

And though lithium is commonly mined from hard rock, the majority of the world's lithium reserves are actually found in brine, extremely salty water beneath the Earth's surface.Today, brine mining involves evaporating the brine in massive, extravagantly colored pools over a series of about 18 months, leaving high concentrations of lithium behind. It's a simple but inefficient process that takes up vast swaths of land and is ecologically disruptive.related investing newsThis beaten-down sector could be a bright spot in commercial real estate  Christina Cheddar Berk3 hours agoAs automakers around the world struggle to meet extraordinarily ambitious electric vehicle production targets, there's growing interest in doing things differently.\u00a0\"The auto industry requires a 20x increase in lithium supply, and there's just no way to achieve that type of growth with conventional technologies,\" said Dave Snydacker, founder and CEO of Lilac Solutions.Lilac is one of a number of companies piloting a set of new and largely unproven technologies called direct lithium extraction, or DLE, which could increase the efficiency and decrease the negative externalities of the brine mining process.Instead of concentrating lithium by evaporating brine in large pools, DLE pulls the brine directly into a processing unit, puts it through a series of chemical processes to separate the lithium, then injects it back underground. This process produces battery-grade lithium carbonate or hydroxide in a matter of hours, without the need to transport concentrated brine to a separate processing facility.DLE could also help jump-start the domestic lithium mining market. Today, most lithium brine mining takes place in the Salar de Atacama, an expansive salt flat in northern Chile that contains the highest quality lithium brine in the world. But DLE technologies require much less land and can help unlock resources in areas where the brine contains less lithium and more impurities.North American companies Lilac Solutions, EnergyX and Standard Lithium are exploring lithium resources in areas such as Arkansas' Smackover Formation, California's Salton Sea and Utah's Great Salt Lake, as well as abroad in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. The Chilean government has even announced that all new lithium projects will be required to use DLE technology.\"So the timing is right and ripe for this to see the light of day very, very soon,\" said Amit Patwardhan, CTO of EnergyX.Direct lithium extraction company EnergyX is building demonstration plants in Argentina, Chile, California, Utah and Arkansas.EnergyXDoing things differentlyIn a world before electric vehicles, traditional methods of brine mining and hard rock mining more than sufficed to meet global lithium demand.\"The world didn't need DLE for the last 50 years. Lithium's primary use was industrial \u2014 ceramics, glass and lubricants,\" said Robert Mintak, CEO of Standard Lithium.But with demand for EVs and the lithium-ion batteries that power them booming, now there's a supply crunch.\u00a0\"Over the last 10 years, 90% of new lithium production has come from hard rock projects. But hard rock projects are increasingly expensive as we go into lower grade resources. And if you add up all the hard rock projects, there's just not enough resource out there to meet automaker goals. It's the brine resources that are large enough to electrify the vehicle industry,\" Snydacker said.DLE is already being used to some extent in both Argentina and China, where the companies Livent and Sunresin are implementing commercial tech that combines DLE with traditional evaporation pond operations.These companies both rely on a technology called adsorption, the only commercially proven approach to DLE. In this process, lithium molecules in the brine adhere to an adsorbant substance, removing them from surrounding impurities. But experts say that stripping the lithium from the adsorbents requires a lot of fresh water, a big problem considering many of the world's best brine resources are in arid areas.Livent's most recent sustainability report indicates that it uses 71.4 metric tons of fresh water per metric ton of lithium carbonate equivalent, or LCE, produced. Lilac reported that in pilot testing it uses between 10 and 20 metric tons of fresh water, while EnergyX says it uses less than 20 metric tons.China-based Sunresin says that it recycles all of its fresh water, and that its newer projects will operate without evaporation ponds.But a host of other companies are now getting into the industry, testing out alternative technologies which they claim will not only eliminate evaporation ponds altogether, but increase yields while lowering energy and fresh water requirements.New playersBay Area-based Lilac Solutions is using a technology called ion exchange. It's currently piloting its tech in Argentina in partnership with Australian lithium company Lake Resources.\"With the Lilac ion-exchange bead we've developed a ceramic material. This ceramic selectively absorbs lithium from the brine while releasing a proton. Once the lithium is absorbed into the material, we then flush the lithium out of the bead using dilute acid and that produces a lithium chloride concentrate which can be easily processed into battery grade chemicals,\" Snydacker explained.Lilac Solutions is developing a direct lithium extraction facility in Argentina in partnership with Australian lithium company Lake Resources.Lilac SolutionsLilac expects to have its first commercial-scale module operating before the end of 2024. The company is backed by BMW and the Bill Gates-funded Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Ford has signed a nonbinding agreement to buy lithium from its Argentina plant.EnergyX, which is based out of both San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Austin, Texas, uses a combination of technologies that it can tailor to the specific brine resource. Step one is traditional adsorption, followed by a method known as \"solvent extraction,\" in which the concentrated brine is mixed with an organic liquid. The lithium is then transferred to the organic before it's stripped free and concentrated. Membrane filtration is the final stage, which removes all remaining impurities.\"So you see these all these loops and synergies that come out of combining these technologies. And that is another big differentiator in what EnergyX does and what really drives the cost of the technology much lower compared to anybody else,\" said Patwardhan.EnergyX is building demonstration plants with undisclosed partners in Argentina, Arkansas, Chile, California and Utah, and is aiming to have the first two up and running by the end of this year. Recently, the company secured $50 million in funding from GM to help scale its tech.Vancouver-based Standard Lithium also has big backers. The public company's largest investor is Koch Industries, and it's been running a demonstration plant in South Arkansas for the last three years, producing lithium at a preexisting bromine plant.The company uses both ion-exchange and adsorption technologies, depending on the resource. It expects to begin construction on a commercial-scale DLE facility next year and is expanding into Texas as well.\"We have an opportunity as we expand from Arkansas to Texas to be the largest producing area for lithium chemicals in North America, utilizing in an area that's not under water stress, that has a social license to operate,\" said Mintak.Companies such as Standard Lithium, which are leaning into the U.S. market, stand to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, which ties electric vehicle subsidies to domestic sourcing of battery materials. Automakers can also receive the full EV credit if they source from countries that have free trade agreements with the U.S., such as Chile.While Chile has announced that all new lithium projects in the country will be required to use DLE technologies, it has not announced what companies it will be partnering with for these new projects.Neighboring Bolivia\u00a0 is also looking to utilize direct lithium extraction to help unlock the country's vast, but largely undeveloped, lithium resources. The government has tapped a consortium of Chinese companies, led by battery giant CATL, to spearhead DLE efforts in its salt flats, and is considering a future partnership with Lilac as well.Most new lithium supply will continue to come from hard rock projects for the rest of this decade, Snydacker said. \"But by the end of this decade, we'll see very large-scale brine projects coming online ...\" he predicted. \"And going out into the next decade, this technology will provide a majority of new supply.\"Overall, lithium production from DLE is projected to grow from about 54,000 metric tons today to 647,500 metric tons by 2032, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. That's forecast to be worth about $21.6 billion.\"But when we place it in relative terms against the rest of the global market, that only represents around 15% of total supply,\" said James Mills, principal consultant at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. \"So we're still going to have to rely on traditional forms of production for the lithium units, whether it's evaporation ponds or hard rock mining.\"Correction: Lilac Solutions is still being considered for a future partnership with the Bolivian government for direct lithium extraction.

fields\n\n\n\n\n PARIS (Reuters) -     French mining group Eramet has opened an office in Chile, it said on Monday, as it looks to develop lithium production in South America to supply battery makers.\nThe office, whose role is to \"support future technical and commercial operations\", will be mainly focused on business development and exploration, it said. \nEramet is due to start lithium production next year in Argentina in partnership with Chinese steel group Tsingshan, and has said it is interested in studying other potential sites in a lithium-rich zone of South America that also includes Chile.\nSouth America's lithium deposits are drawing intense interest as makers of electric vehicle batteries look to secure supply chains. The European Union sees raw materials as a key issue in talks over a trade deal with the Mercosur bloc of South American countries.\nEramet, which is 27% held by the French state, is the world's leading producer of manganese, and a major nickel supplier.\nAt home, it is among companies exploring geothermal extraction of lithium in the Rhine basin around the French-German border, and is also studying a battery recycling project with environmental services group Suez. \nSecuring supplies of battery materials like lithium is a key priority for the French government, which is funding projects by Eramet and other firms such as Imerys.\n\n (Reporting by GV De Clercq and Gus Trompiz; Editing by Benoit Van Overstraeten)\n \u00a9 Reuters 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocks mentioned in the articleChangeLast1st jan.\n\nERAMET\u00a0-0.71% 90.4 8.65%\n\nEURO / ARGENTINE PESO (EUR/ARS)\u00a00.38% 261.5079 37.46%\n\nIMERYS\u00a00.41% 34.64 -5.06%\n\nUS DOLLAR / ARGENTINE PESO (USD/ARS)\u00a00.03% 243.57 37.60%\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll news about\u00a0ERAMET\n\n\n\n\n06/05France's Eramet opens Chile office in lithium pushRE\n\n06/05Eramet : French mining group Eramet announces the opening of an office in ChilePU\n\n06/05Christine D\u00e9n\u00e9riaz, Eramet Environme : \"Stronger commitments to reduce our impact.\"PU\n\n06/01Tsingshan says Argentina lithium plan with Eramet to total $1.7 billionRE\n\n06/01Eramet no longer sees LME as benchmark for ferronickel -reportRE\n\n05/26INTERVIEW - Christel Bories, CEO of Eramet: a diffi..MT\n\n05/26ERAMET : Ex-dividend day for final dividendFA\n\n05/23Eramet : Approval of resolutions proposed to the Ordinary Shareholders' General Meeting of..GL\n\n05/23Eramet : Approval of resolutions proposed to the Ordinary Shareholders' General Meeting of..AQ\n\n05/23ERAMET S.A.

THIS NEWS RELEASE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OR SALE OF SECURITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. TORONTO, June  05, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Full Circle Lithium Corp. (\u201cFCL\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV:FCLI), a USA-based lithium products manufacturer and recycler with a highly experienced and proven technical team and a fully permitted lithium processing plant in Georgia, is pleased to provide an update regarding the Company\u2019s rapid progress in installing its first modular demonstration lithium extraction and processing plant (the \u201cFCL Demo Plant\u201d) for a multinational chemical company (\u201cChemicalCo1\u201d) at one of its specialty chemical plants in the USA. Please refer to the news release date May 10, 2023 \u201cFull Circle Lithium Installing Lithium Recycling Demo Processing Plant at Multinational Chemical Company\u2019s Site\u201d for further information. Key equipment containing the Company\u2019s proprietary lithium extraction and processing technology (or \u201cLEP\u201d technology) is being shipped to ChemicalCo1\u2019s site (For pictures of the FCL Demo Plant, please see www.fullcirclelithium.com under Photo Gallery). Initial site review and civil/mechanical engineering design work have commenced at the site, and all site preparation and interconnections to FCL\u2019s tanks and other equipment already shipped and on site are being completed. FCL will also be shipping its LEP control module to manage the FCL Demo Plant on-site and remotely from the control center at the Georgia plant once in operation. \u201cThis has been a highly technical process and we are ecstatic to now be at this stage,\u201d said Mr. Carlos Vicens, Founder, CEO & Director of FCL. \u201cIt has taken an enormous amount of work from our entire team to be where we are today. There are a lot of moving parts, everything is now coming together and we are looking forward to having our Demo Plant installed and commissioned in a very short period of time.\u201d The purpose of the FCL Demo Plant is to demonstrate at a large scale and under industrial conditions, using FCL\u2019s LEP technology, the Company's ability to extract and process ChemicalCo1's lithium that is lost in the manufacturing process and to produce a lithium product of sufficient purity and that meets all specifications for purchase and direct use by ChemicalCo1. Given its modular design, the FCL Demo Plant can be expanded into an operating commercial plant. Once in full production, the modular FCL commercial plant will be designed for an initial capacity of 500 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent per annum, and capacity can be expanded as required. Through extensive testing the FCL LEP technology has proven highly successful in extracting lithium over a large number of cycles. The Company has built and is operating large-scale equipment for commercial-scale production of its LEP technology. The FCL Demo Plant and FCL LEP technology are environmentally focused processes using minimal reagents. FCL is aligned with the sustainability and cost objectives of its customers, communities and governmental infrastructure initiatives. Full Circle Lithium Corp.

Picture taken May 22, 2020. REUTERS/MacDonald DzirutweZimbabwe wants lithium miners operating in the country to work towards producing battery-grade lithium locally and could impose a tax on exports of lithium concentrate in future, Mines minister Winston Chitando said last Wednesday.The southern African country holds significant reserves of lithium, a battery mineral which is vital to the global drive towards cleaner energy technologies, which Zimbabwe hopes will help revive its ailing economy.Chinese firms including Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, Sinomine Resource Group, Chengxin Lithium Group and Canmax Technologies have spent more than US$1 billion over the past two years to acquire and develop lithium projects in Zimbabwe.Some of these companies' projects have started production and are expected to build up to a combined annual output of nearly 1,5 million tonnes of lithium concentrates over the next year.Last year, Zimbabwe banned the export of unprocessed lithium ore to stop rampant digging and smuggling of the mineral by artisanal miners, ordering that only lithium concentrates could be exported.\n\n\nIt now wants miners to go beyond the production of concentrates, which are shipped for further processing outside the country, mostly to China.\"Obviously, what the government wants is to move up the value chain, but it won't happen overnight,\" Chitando said in an address at the Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines annual general meeting.He added that some lithium miners had plans to eventually produce battery-grade lithium locally.\"As government, once we have an entity which can value-add beyond lithium concentrates and go a stage higher, two things will happen; the extreme case will be to ban the export of lithium concentrates, which won't happen, or we will impose a levy,\" he said.Huayou, which invested about US$700 million to acquire and develop Zimbabwe's Arcadia lithium mine in 2022, said in June last year it could not commit to producing battery-grade lithium in the near term.The company, China's top cobalt refiner, said Zimbabwe, like most African countries, lacked renewable power and key materials needed to produce battery-grade lithium, such as natural gas and chemicals, whose importation would be unaffordable.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSource - Reuters \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       More on: #Miners, #Lithium, #Battery \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

HIGHLIGHTS Mining License Application and Environmental Impact Assessment submission works progressing.San Jos\u00e9 Lithium Project tenure comprises all-encompassing granted Exploration Permit PESE.Former multiple permits now replaced by single granted Permit.Local and regional elections complete \u2013 national election period commenced.Positive Project development pathway remains unchanged by election results and the Company looks forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders. The Company welcomes the opportunity to engage with local and regional government representatives following the positive C\u00e1ceres local and Extremadura regional elections on 28 May 2023. The national election period was subsequently announced and will be decided in polls on 23 July 2023. The Company anticipates the finalisation of the Regional Government following the national election period. Extremadura New Energies CEO Ramon Jimenez commented \u201cWe are looking forward to engaging positively and directly with incoming local and regional representatives who have highlighted the benefits of the Project and desire to progress with the requisite environmental, technical and economic benefits for the region. The community recognises the generational opportunities aligned to the Project development and complimentary industries as the global race for critical raw materials intensifies\u201d.Popular Party (\u2018PP\u2019) leader and incoming Mayor of C\u00e1ceres Rafael Mateos highlighted in the weeks leading into the election the position of the PP party, \u201cAs long as there is no environmental damage to the city, to the surroundings of Valdefl\u00f3rez, and that there are industries associated with the project, we will support it.\u201d Extremadura New Energies will progress the Mining License Application (\u2018MLA\u2019) and Environmental Impact Assessment (\u2018EIA\u2019) submission included under the ECA incorporating the responses from local and regional stakeholders detailed in the EIA Scoping Document (refer to ASX announcement 9 May 2023). Technical and administrative works are continuing throughout the election period and the Company anticipates the submission of the ECA in Q4 2023. The administrative process to submit the ECA has been altered to include the extended PESE Project tenure. The High Court of Justice of Extremadura (\u2018the Court\u2019) has determined that the investigation permits previously contained within the new project area PESE are annulled, and therefore the Project area now comprises entirely of PESE.

Similar positive results have been experienced on a further six targets currently undergoing target evaluation. HighlightsSensOre has identified lithium fertile pegmatite signatures on 3 of 4 joint-venture targets where initial fieldwork has commenced.Anomalous lithium and lithium index pathfinder elements identified in ultrafine soil sample and pXRF geochemical analysis.Lithium fertile pegmatites and pegmatite signatures have been confirmed on additional AI ML generated lithium targets, additional joint-ventures are expected to be closed in coming months.Pending the success of SensOre\u2019s New South Wales geophysics research and development, next steps involve the application of techniques to existing appropriate available radiometric data layers and low-level radiometric and magnetic data acquisition as rapid first assessment of lithium fertility of known pegmatite fields. SensOre CEO Richard Taylor said: \"A high hit rate of targets with pegmatites outcropping or evidence of geochemistry associated with concealed pegmatites is an exciting start to our field programs. Potential coupling with our geophysical R&D, we will be in a good position for drilling programs planned for later this year. Many of the major lithium mines in Western Australia started from identification of pegmatite swarms on surface. Lithium is key to our battery industries in Australia and new methods of detecting fertile systems are to be sources of growth for the industry.\"Identifying pegmatites together with geochemical pegmatite indicators is validating SensOre\u2019s AI and Machine Learning (ML) generated lithium targets from work in mid-late 2022. SensOre\u2019s targeting involves deployment of AI ML technologies on its giant Western Australia hyper cube consisting of thousands of fused geoscience data layers including a proprietary granite fertility layer. Four joint ventures have been executed to date in addition to three new tenement applications. Work continues assessing many additional predicted targets across Western Australia. This target analysis and joint venture negotiations are expected to add additional joint-ventures in the short to medium term.Identification of pegmatites or geochemical pegmatite indicators in the near surface is an important first step in SensOre\u2019s lithium exploration activity to validate target generation. SensOre\u2019s targets are a mixture of outcropping pegmatites or under shallow transported cover and require application of either conventional surface geochemical and geophysical techniques or application of SensOre\u2019s geochemical and geophysical AI ML toolkit for lithium exploration.One of these new detection tools includes the possible deployment in Western Australia of a research and development project being undertaken in NSW.1SensOre recently completed a low level radiometric and magnetic data acquisition program in the Curnamona region on Western NSW. The objective of this survey and the research and development is to field validate desktop studies that show detection of a caesium isotope signatures is possible in radiometric surveys. Caesium is present in LCT pegmatites so can be used for assessment of pegmatites for lithium fertility. Figure 1 \u2013 SensOre Lithium project portfolio June 2023Work on existing exploration projects presented in figure 1 is summarised below.Golden Grove North Joint Venture2The Golden Grove North project, located in the Yalgoo greenstone belt, is an emerging lithium fertile camp which contains the advanced LCT lithium pegmatite project held by Firetail, near the Melville gold deposit. This Joint venture with Venture minerals (ASX - VMS), within the Deutche Rohstoff joint venture subsidiary EXAI,3was EXAI\u2019s most recent project addition. Exploration fieldwork commenced in May evaluating the prospectivity of the area and will be ramping up in coming months. The project tenure is large and is known to host mapped felsic intrusives and pegmatitic rocks. EXAI plans to conduct initial systematic mapping and sampling to determine fertility and identify potential high priority areas. SensOre\u2019s AI-generated lithium fertile granites are associated with the targets across the joint venture tenure. Reported evidence of LCT pegmatites adjacent to the project makes it a compelling area and, once the due diligence period is completed, EVAI plan to complete extensive field investigations prior to drill testing planned for 2H 2023.Montague Joint Venture4SensOre\u2019s proprietary DPT\u00ae and mineral Adjacency Mapping targeting technologies together with geochemical analysis has identified a large compelling target within a region with no previous lithium exploration. Regionally the project is located west of the Ida Fault where generally the LCT pegmatite occurrences are closely associated with the margins of greenstone belts and fertile granites where zones of structural complexity are evident. The project is highly prospective with existing drilling and surface GSWA reported geochemistry compiled by SensOre highlighting LCT pegmatite fertility and GSWA mapping identifying many pegmatite occurrences. The greenstone lithologies are favourable, dominated by mafic and ultramafic rocks, especially within 1-5km of surrounding recently assessed fertile granite contacts. Additionally, the structural complexity and upper greenschist metamorphic grade further highlight the potential of the broader mining camp. SensOre through EXAI are focusing on evaluating the large and high-quality geochemical database, mapping and sampling the surrounding pegmatites within the Gum Creek Greenstone belt to determine fertility from soil geochemistry under areas of thin cover surrounding the Montague mining area. Current work includes undertaking unsupervised machine learning evaluation of large geochemical data bases as well as traditional geological mapping and auger sampling to generate drill targets planned for testing in 2H 2023.Gecko North5DPT and lithium prospectivity mapping using geochemistry, geology and geophysics has predicted a prospective area within 10km of the Eastern Goldfields Terrane boundary (Ida Fault). The area is predominantly mafic sequence with upper greenschist to lower amphibolite metamorphism. The geochemistry and geology contain many known Area Selection Criteria (ASC) which ticks a lot of boxes for evaluating LCT pegmatite potential.EVAI are targeting 1-5km around the outside of the granite in a favourable structural and lithological position. Evidence of LCT pegmatites have been identified to the north and south further highlighting the potential for LCT fertility under shallow transported and residual cover. Reconnaissance mapping has shown much of the area has thin transported cover and residual regolith. Surface geochemistry (ultrafine soils) has identified several anomalies. Further work is being undertaken to better define the anomalies and delineate drill targets below cover for testing in 2H 2023.

(LAC), LAC:CA13 Comments17 LikesQuinn Coughlin37 FollowersFollowSummaryLithium Americas Corp. is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the global demand for lithium, with substantial lithium reserves, strategic production plans, and backing by GM.The company is expecting to initiate lithium production at the Argentine Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz site by June 2023 and is also advancing on the Thacker Pass project in the United States.Despite the current volatility of lithium prices, LAC's long-term valuation holds potential, with industry forecasts indicating a considerable increase in the demand for lithium in the coming years.Given LAC's promising growth trajectory, strategic positioning, and commitment to fulfilling the global lithium market's needs, it is considered a strong mid-term growth stock with a buy rating.Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Quinn Coughlin as a new contributor.

Click here to find out more \u00bb Just_Super Investment Thesis In a world thirsting for batteries, Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC, TSX:LAC:CA) stands as an oasis, ready to quench the market's thirst with their untapped lithium reserves. As lithium prices dance to the rhythm of rising demand, LAC's vast resources, coupled with a strategic game plan, are poised to make a splash in this young growing market. Background Lithium Americas Corp. finds itself at the intersection of several global trends: the rise in electric vehicle (EVs) adoption, the growing demand for lithium, and the geopolitics of resource extraction. Production Capabilities and Outlook At the Argentine Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz site, mechanical construction has been completed, with the first lithium production targeted for June 2023. The site aims to ramp up to 40,000 tons per annum (~$1.28 billion in annualized revenue) of battery-quality lithium carbonate by Q1 2024. Operating costs at this plant are extremely favorable at $3,579 per ton of LCE. Additionally, a Stage 2 expansion is being planned to further increase lithium carbonate production. The company has also continued advancing the $30 million development plan at the Pastos Grandes Basin, with a construction decision expected in Q4 2023. In the United States, the Thacker Pass project has commenced construction following receipt of notice to proceed from the Bureau of Land Management. Major earthworks are expected to begin in Q2 2023, supporting a target to start production in the second half of 2026. This project has received substantial support in the form of a memorandum of understanding with Bechtel Corporation and the North American Building Trade Unions, along with a potential funding contribution from the DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. This is an encouraging step as they now look to be out of the legal woodwork. This site is expected to produce 80,000 tons per annum once at full capacity in 2029 and will operate at half capacity from start of production until then. Additionally LAC expects the operating cost of the mine will be $6,743 per ton of LCE which is a quite favorable operating margin. Recent Developments In a bid to streamline its operations and potentially mitigate geopolitical risks, Lithium Americas Corp. announced to separate its Argentine and North American business units into two independent public companies during their earning call on May 15, 2023. The separation will have the current Argentina-based assets roll up to \"Lithium Argentina.\" The 100%-owned Thacker Pass lithium project in Humboldt County, Nevada, as well as the company's investments in Green Technology Metals Limited (OTCPK:GTMLF) (ASX:GT1) and Ascend Elements, Inc. will all roll up to \"Lithium Americas (NewCo)\". Their 6-K filing indicates this decision was made with the intention of providing companies with more narrow strategic focuses and to better pursue their independent growth opportunities. This move was also partly motivated by the complex dynamics of US-China relations and to distance the company from one of its top shareholders, Ganfeng Lithium Group Co., a Chinese lithium producer. Lithium Americas will file a circular with specific details on the separation by the end of June 2023 and will go to a shareholder vote July 31st, 2023. For now, their 6-k cites \"Under the plan of arrangement, shareholders will retain their proportionate interest in shares of the Company and receive newly issued shares of Lithium Americas (NewCo) in proportion to their then-current ownership of the Company\". Financial Strength As of Q1 2023, Lithium Americas Corp. held $604.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term bank deposits. Total assets amounted to $1,328.4 million, with real long-term liabilities at $213.7 million. This financial strength has been boosted primarily by a substantial equity investment by General Motors Holdings LLC, which agreed to invest $650 million ($320 million being realized on balance sheet in Q1) into the company and receive exclusive access to Phase 1 production at Thacker Pass. Net change in cash was up $327 million this quarter which is an important development after the past two quarters both being down over $300 million. It is unclear what the separation means for the assets and cash on hand for both entities. We do know that the estimated cost to get Thacker Pass operational is $581 million and GM has committed to invest an additional $330 million that has not been realized on the balance sheet. Even with the unknown terms of the separation LAC's healthy cash holdings will be able to sustain the North American business until Thacker Pass starts producing. The Bull Thesis In late April Elon Musk stated, \"We are begging you. We do not want to do it! Instead of making a picture-sharing app, please refine lithium. Mining and refining. Heavy industry. Come on!\". Elon's statement was a reinforcement of the bull thesis for the Lithium Mining sector. Bottom-line is countries across the world are pushing for EV and clean energy adoption and lithium batteries are the best way to store energy. The world output of lithium batteries in 2022 was 737,000 tons with 2023 production currently forecasted at 964,000 tons. McKinsey's most recent projections have the need for lithium by 2030 to be at 3-4 million tons. That is an industry-wide CAGR of 17.6% in the bear case and up to 22.5% in the bull case. It is clear with the industry needing to meet the growing demand every Lithium producer deserves a look right now. The question is which firms are best positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. The Elephant in the Room There is no doubt the market growth needed to meet global demand creates excellent upside potential. That being said, the valuation of LAC and competitors is and always will be tied to the price of lithium. Lithium has been on a wild ride this past year being one of the most volatile commodities over that period. This price action is the leading argument for bearish sentiment in the stock and is the reason LAC is down nearly 50% off of the highs. www.dailymetalprice.com/metalpricecharts.php?c=li&u=kg&d=240 With the rapid fall in price, it's easy to wonder if 30k/ton will hold and if it is a fair baseline to use for forecasting revenue. We do not see this as a dead cat bounce. There are several geopolitical, supply chains, as well as a pandemic that became macro factors that lead to lithium's parabolic rise and fall over the past 2 years. The headwinds of lower EV sales and expected higher inventories in the next few years have caused an overcorrection in our view, we see the bounce off ~24k as price stabilization. More forward-looking, the price is now in range for our consensus average of $31k for the year. We believe with production increasing and steady growth in (EVs) average lithium price with a stay between 31k - 37k per ton into 2028. Valuation Analysis Contrary to our peer analysts we see the price of lithium as a major bull factor. Currently analysts are for LAC's internal finance team and our peers are using $24,000/ton as the average rate over the lifetime of the mine. We see this as far off. With high inflation, global economic slowdown, and recessionary concerns it makes sense that demand has cooled off in the past year. That being said demand will not stay at the current levels as nations push for (EVs) and green energy. Furthermore LAC will not start production until Q1 2024 and won't reach peak production until 2029 so the current dip and macro conditions do not change the prospective future cash flows. For revenue forecasting, we used an average price of 31k growing 3.6% annually. Further out we believe demand will continue to grow faster than production and lead to market shortages where we might see more substantiated price growth. Target Price and Fair Value With production not reaching full output until 2029, this is a long-term play. There is room for price to play around leading up to the start of Argentine production next year, in the meantime with the uncertainty of the nuisances behind the separation, lithium prices, and overall macro conditions over the next 3 years. Looking at the end of 2026 this is a company that will be doing just over $2 billion in revenue. To be conservative and account for possible variance in timeframes and cost we take a 10% haircut off that figure. Being that this is a pre-revenue company the easiest method with the least amount of assumptions is revenue multiples. We have bear case as 3x revenue, base as 4x, and bull as 5x. We used industry averages and cut them by 5% to get to these multiples.     Bull Case Base Case Bear Case   2026 $10.34 billion $8.27 billion $6.20 billion   2029 $24.21 billion $19.37 billion $14.53 billion   Click to enlarge The target is in the market cap of the combined entity as it is not possible to predict how shares outstanding will be divided between the two new entities. Additionally we did a discounted cash flow analysis using our revenue forecast to and cost assumptions to calculate Free Cash Flow as below in millions:                2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032   $10.4 $154.1 $159.7 $268.8 $399.9 $532.8 $727.4 $822.0 $871.1 $940.8   Click to enlarge We calculated WACC ourselves as shown below. Tax rate is a conservative estimate, currently LAC does not have income so they have no historical tax rate we can use. DCF Analysis (Author's Calculations) Comparatively the consensus among analysts is a mean 12 month price target at a market cap of $5.79 billion with a buy rating. Risk Exposure We see exposure in three places for LAC. One is the uncertainty of the new capital structure and how the shares will be split post-Separation. Two is the chance of geopolitical issues in Argentina such as changes in export tariffs, environmental regulations, or mining laws could have a substantial impact on LAC's profitability and operational efficiency. As well as issues with China as they are a significant player in the lithium market, and any changes in its policies or economic conditions could impact lithium demand. As mentioned before, Chinese company Ganfeng Lithium owns a significant portion of the operations in Argentina. Beneficially, risk one is a precautionary measure for risk two. By separating the Argentine mines into a new company it prevents Ganfeng from interfering with the North American business. Overall, I think this current situation is being played well by the board and we anticipate the terms of the deal to not be compromising financial sanctity of the business. Lastly, the greatest risk is in the value of lithium dropping further lowering future revenues. Though unlikely a drop in price to $16k for example could cut forecasted revenue in half. That being said, we stand by our price analysis above. Additionally any short term drop in price will not affect the ability of LAC to finance construction as they have built their financing models on a price of 24k which we are comfortably above. Conclusion  Lithium Americas Corp. is strategically positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for lithium, with substantial developments in its production capabilities. With a 12-month target valuation of $6 billion we rate LAC as a buy. This is a strong mid-term growth stock that can be DCA'd over the next 6 months. Its revenue potential to the current market cap of $3.6 billion is enticing and investors may want to consider Lithium Americas Corp. for its promising growth trajectory and commitment to meeting the needs of the global lithium market.This article was written byQuinn Coughlin37 FollowersFollowFounder and CIO of QOE Capital a multi strategy quant fund.Analyst\u2019s Disclosure: I/we have no stock, option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned, and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours.

Peter Gerber\nIn 2021, four persons died and 79 were injured in 104 lithium-ion battery-fueled blazes in homes, fire officials said. \nLast year,\u00a0those numbers took a concerning climb: six people were killed and 142 hurt in 220 battery-related fires.\nCouncilman Robert Holden (D-Queens) has introduced legislation to ban electric scooters and bikes until safeguards are in place. \n\n\n\nCity landlords were required to post an FDNY safety guide by April 30 warning apartment dwellers about fires caused by e-bike batteries.Peter Gerber\n\u201cThe reckless rush to legalize e-mobility devices without regulation has unleashed a terrifying wave of fires, injuries, and tragic deaths,\u201d Holden told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to witness the consequences of the previous City Council\u2019s ill-advised actions as these incidents become more and more common.\u201d\nHolden wants electric scooters and e-bikes to be \u201cregistered, licensed, inspected, and insured like any other motor vehicle. If we fail to take action, we\u2019ll continue to witness the loss of precious lives.\u201d\nCity landlords were required to post an FDNY safety guide by April 30 warning apartment dwellers about fires caused by e-bike batteries.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reckless rush to legalize e-mobility devices without regulation has unleashed a terrifying wave of fires, injuries, and tragic deaths,\u201d said Councilman Robert Holden.Tomas E. Gaston\nE-bikes should not be charged overnight or when residents are out, nor should they be stored near windows or exits, the FDNY has warned. \nThey should also have approved certification markings.\nThe owners of one luxe 44-story building on West 57th Street last week informed its tenants that  \u201cEffective immediately, electric micro-mobility devices, including but not limited to electric scooters, electric bicycles, personal e-mobility devices, light electrical vehicle applications, and any other devices with a lithium-ion battery, can no longer be stored in bike rooms.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart move because these lithium-ion batteries are scary,\u201d a building tenant told The Post. \u201cIf one explodes they can all go up in flames.\u201d\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppEmailCopy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbatteries\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbikes\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfdny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfires\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n6/3/23 \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMSG and Penn Station are 'not compatible': MTA\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n what to shop now\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWork smarter, not harder, with a wearable or smartwatch from Best Buy to track health, sleep and more\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese 18 air purifiers will have you saying goodbye to seasonal allergies and improve air quality\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeel good wherever you go with the best walking shoes for men, according to a podiatrist\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Father's Day gifts 2023: 62 ideas for every kind of dad\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't drop the ball on dad!

A murder investigation was launched after the body of Ion Radu, 46, was found in a car park in Homelands Drive.Metropolitan Police officers were called at 9.24am on Thursday after a member of the public found Mr Radu unresponsive.He was confirmed dead at the scene.A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the liver.Detective chief inspector Sal Minhas, who is leading the investigation, said: \u201cI am very keen to hear from anyone who saw Ion in the 48 hours before he died.\u201cWe think that Ion may have been homeless and potentially vulnerable.

If you spoke to him, was he worried or upset about anything?\u201cWe are working to build a picture of Ion\u2019s life and we need the public to help us.\u201cIf you have information that you want to share, no matter how insignificant it might seem, please get in touch.\u201dPolice said enquiries are ongoing to trace any living relatives.Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or tweet @MetCC quoting 1924/01JUNE.More aboutCrystal PalaceLondonScotland YardCrimestoppers1/1Homeless man stabbed to death in Crystal Palace car park\n\nHomeless man stabbed to death in Crystal Palace car parkThe body of Ion Radu, 46, was found in a car park in Homelands DriveMet Police    \n\u2715Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Company appreciates the support it has received from the DOE over the years and looks forward to future partnership opportunities.\n\n\nAs Amprius works to meet the significant demand for its ultra-high energy density lithium-ion batteries, the Company remains unchanged in its focus on achieving mass production scale and delivering on its product roadmap. The decision to exit the DOE program provides the Company with significantly more operational flexibility in scale, vendor and supply chain management, product portfolio development and speed required for the success of large-scale manufacturing of Amprius\u2019 high energy density batteries in the United States.\n\n\n\u201cOur priority remains scaling up the first large-scale production site for the world\u2019s next-generation battery cells in Brighton, Colorado as part of our drive to ensure that a clean energy future is American-made,\u201d said Dr. Kang Sun, Chief Executive Officer of Amprius Technologies. \u201cWe continue to deliver on our commitments and are making significant progress in expanding our existing commercial production in Fremont, California and our new, large-scale production in Brighton, Colorado sites.\u201d\n\n\nAmprius\u2019 current level of battery performance demonstrates that the Company has the capability to deliver battery cells using its proprietary anode technology that have a specific energy and energy density that approach 2X the performance of graphite cells currently available for purchase. Amprius\u2019 commercially available batteries today deliver up to 450 Wh/kg and 1,150 Wh/L, the industry\u2019s highest known energy density cells available on the market today. Most recently the Company\u2019s batteries were independently verified to perform at 500 Wh/kg and 1,300 Wh/L. Amprius has military, commercial and defense segment customers who are integrating this capacity into their product plans in order to serve critical national security needs.\n\n\nIn March of 2023, Amprius announced plans to build a gigawatt-scale factory in Brighton, Colorado for its next-generation lithium-ion batteries with its Silicon Anode Platform. The DOE funding of $50 million was only a portion of the expected cost to complete the initial phase of 500 MWh production. This facility is planned to create 330 full-time jobs and is still expected to be operational by 2025. Amprius plans to continue its commercialization plans that include a multi-phased approach.\n\n\nFor more information on Amprius, please visit the Company\u2019s investor relations website at https://ir.amprius.com.\n\n\nAbout Amprius Technologies, Inc.\n\nAmprius Technologies, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of high-energy and high-power lithium-ion batteries producing the industry\u2019s highest known energy density cells. The company\u2019s commercially available batteries deliver up to 450 Wh/kg and 1,150 Wh/L. The company\u2019s corporate headquarters is in Fremont, California where it maintains an R&D lab and a pilot manufacturing facility for the fabrication of silicon anodes and cells.

This mental health condition can afflict anyone, including your family and friends.\nDespite the advancements in psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions, many individuals with symptoms of depression face challenges in achieving remission. And maintaining long-term recovery becomes an issue as well.\u00a0\nIntroduced as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder,[2] lithium\u2019s profile in treating depression has been of growing interest.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll highlight the many facets of lithium for depression.\n\nIs Lithium Good For Depression?\nLithium is an effective treatment for depression, particularly in cases of bipolar depression or when other treatments have proven ineffective.\nLithium helps stabilize mood, alleviate depressive symptoms, and prevent suicide attempts. It\u2019s often used as an augmentation agent when standard antidepressants fail to offer relief, although it is also used as monotherapy.\nLithium for depression should only be used after consulting a mental healthcare specialist. Regular monitoring is essential to ensure optimal treatment outcomes.\n\nWhat Is Lithium?\nLithium is an alkali element present in the earth\u2019s crust. Historically, the use of lithium in psychiatry dates back to the 19th century. According to some research, it is one of the most effective[3] psychotropic medications for treating mental illness disorders.\nLithium salts, such as lithium carbonate and lithium citrate, stabilize the brain\u2019s chemicals, reducing mood swings,[4] improving sleep, and alleviating[5] other depression symptoms.\nHow Does Lithium Treat Depression?\nLithium has been used as a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder,[6] a condition characterized by episodes of mania and depression. You can also apply it as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder when antidepressant medications are ineffective.\nAccording to research, lithium\u2019s antidepressant effects[6] are due to its capacity to control various biochemical processes, including the following:\nImpact On Brain Chemistry\nResearch suggests that lithium affects the chemical messengers[7] in the brain, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid,[8] or GABA. These neurotransmitters affect mood regulation, and lithium\u2019s effects on these systems contribute to its therapeutic benefits.\nLithium stimulates neurotransmission by blocking glutamate reuptake and increasing serotonin levels in the brain, potentially improving mood. Lithium\u2019s effect on dopamine varies depending on the brain region, but it modulates dopamine release and receptor sensitivity.\n\n\n\nFeatured Partner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30,000+ Licensed Therapist\n\n\nSwitch Therapist Anytime\n\n\nOver 3 Million Users\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Therapy, Done Online!\nBetterHelp makes starting therapy easy.

It also increases GABA neurotransmission,[8] contributing to its mood-stabilizing properties.\nInfluence On Gene Expression\nResearch studies propose lithium influences gene expression[9] in specific brain regions. Lithium targets glycogen synthase kinase 3, i.e., GSK-3, which is involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation.\nLithium works as an inhibitor of GSK-3. By doing so, GSK-3 leads to the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway,[10] resulting in changes in gene expression. This pathway is associated with the pathophysiology of mood-related disorders. And lithium\u2019s modulation of this pathway could contribute to its anti-depressive effects.\nEffect On Transcription Factors\nLithium has also been shown to impact chromatin remodeling.[11] Chromatin remodeling influences gene expression by modifying DNA accessibility to transcription factors. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene transcription.\nRegulation of gene transcription can influence depression by altering the expression of genes. These genes are related to neurotransmitter function, neuroplasticity, stress response, and inflammation, which may impact mood, cognition, and emotional well-being.\nLithium may affect the activity of enzymes[12] like histone deacetylases to either promote or inhibit gene expression. By altering the activity patterns of these enzymes,[13] lithium may influence the expression of genes involved in mood regulation and synaptic plasticity.\nInfluence On Neurotrophic Factors\nStudies suggest lithium may influence neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factors, i.e., BDNF.[14] These neurotrophic factors stimulate neuron development and survival, and BDNF is involved in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neural connection maintenance. These factors contribute to mood regulation.\nUnlike other medications, lithium has a much longer half-life,\u00a0 taking 18 \u2013 36 hours[15] to leave the bloodstream. This means lithium medicine can stabilize your mood throughout the day.\u00a0\nWhen Should You Use Lithium For Treating Depression?\nWhen you use lithium to treat depression, it\u2019s often used in conjunction with additional drugs such as antidepressants or even as a monotherapy.\nTreatment-Resistant Depression\nWhen depressed patients fail to respond adequately to standard antidepressant medications, they are considered treatment-resistant major depression. In such cases, you may consider lithium augmentation therapy, and adding lithium to the existing antidepressant regimen can enhance its effectiveness.\nBipolar Spectrum Features\nSome cases occur within a broader bipolar spectrum, including cyclothymic disorder[16] and bipolar II disorder.[17] Patients feel mood fluctuations presenting as hypomanic or manic episodes alternating with low mood states or depression. Mental health specialists may prescribe lithium as a monotherapy to treat these mood disorders and alleviate depressive and manic symptom cycling.\nRecurrent Depression\nIf a person suffers two failed medication treatments or episodes of recurring major depression,[18] taking lithium may be a preventive measure. It helps by reducing the frequency and severity of depressive episodes, thus, acting as a long-term mood stabilizer.\nPersonalized Considerations\nIndividual factors may influence the decision to use lithium for treating depression. They include a positive response to lithium in the past or a possible family history of positive response to lithium.[19]\nWhat About Lithium And Breastfeeding?\nLithium can pass into breast milk, potentially affecting your nursing infant. Breastfeeding while taking lithium[20] should be carefully considered since every pregnancy and mom is different. It carries potential risks and benefits that you should discuss with a healthcare professional to make an informed decision.\nNote: Lithium requires careful monitoring and dosage adjustments to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize side effects. It has a narrow therapeutic range, so regular blood level monitoring[21] is necessary to check lithium levels and maintain effective dose levels.\nLithium Dosage For Depression\nThe dosage of lithium antidepressants varies depending on several factors, including:\n\nThe severity of symptoms.\nTreatment history.\nAge and weight.\nExisting health conditions like kidney disease.\nLifestyle.\nOther medications.\nPresence of breastfeeding.[22]\n\nToo much lithium leads to lithium toxicity[23] which is aggravated in hot weather. This makes it essential to avoid dehydration and to drink the right amount of fluids throughout the day.\nHere\u2019s the recommended lithium dosage for depression:[24]\nDosage FormAcute ManiaLong-Term Treatment of ManiaForms of Oral Dosage (Capsules, Solution, Tablets)\u00a0\u00a0Adults and children 7+, weighing more than 30 kg2-3 times per day, 600 mg or 10 mL.2-3 times daily, 300-600 mg or 5-10 mL.Children 7+ years\u00a0 weighing 20-30 kgConsume 600-1500 mg or 10-25 mL in divided daily doses.Consume 600-1200 mg or 10-20 mL in divided daily doses.Children 7 years+ weighing <20 kgUse and dose are determined by the doctor.Use and dose are determined by the doctor.Children under 7Not recommended.Not recommended.Oral Dosage Form (Extended-Release Tablets)\u00a0\u00a0Adults and children 12+900 mg twice a day or 600 mg three times a day600 mg twice a day or three times a day. Maximum of 1200 mg per day.Children 12 years and youngerNot recommended.Not recommended.\u00a0\u00a0Breastfeeding women600-1200 mg/day\nNote: It\u2019s not recommended to stop taking lithium suddenly, as it leads to a relapse of mania[25] and mood instability. But, if you experience relapsed symptoms, you should call your doctor immediately as you may have to stop suddenly.\u00a0\u00a0\nSide Effects Of Lithium\nLithium is an effective and safe treatment for most people with major depression. But as with any medication, be aware of lithium\u2019s potential adverse side effects,[26] which include:\n\nNausea or vomiting.\nDiarrhea.\nFatigue and drowsiness, dizziness.\nIncreased urination and excessive weight gain.\nDry mouth[27] and excess thirst.[27]\nMuscle weakness or cramps.\nInterference with the production of[28] thyroid hormones.\nUnstable lithium levels due to possible interactions with caffeine,[29] so keep caffeine intake consistent.\nMild hand tremors.\n\nLess commonly, some people may experience more severe side effects[26] such as:\n\nSevere hand tremors.\nLow sodium levels[30] in the blood. Note that it is important to maintain stable sodium[29] intakes as this can affect blood lithium levels.\nLow blood pressure or pulse.\nBlurred vision.\nSkin rashes, redness, and itching.\n\nYou should see a doctor immediately if you experience any adverse side effects They may need to adjust your dosage or try other treatment options. Note that excessive weight gain[26] and extreme fatigue experienced by many lithium users are the primary reasons for medication noncompliance.\nConclusion\nLithium is a potent medication for the treatment of depression diagnosis. It helps by reducing the more severe depressive symptoms, alleviating suicidal thoughts, and improving quality of life. However, you must take lithium correctly with the help of a physician. This includes having regular laboratory tests to monitor for toxicity and the presence of effective blood lithium levels.\nAlthough lithium has side effects, you can usually manage the symptoms by adequate dosing.\u00a0\nBut as always, seek professional help and talk to your doctor to analyze your situation and design a suitable treatment strategy. For example, planning for unwanted weight gain prevention or trying yoga for depression would be wise.\n \n\n+ 30 sources\nHealth Canal avoids using tertiary references.

Any statement describing Ionis' goals, expectations, financial or other projections, intentions or beliefs is a forward-looking statement and should be considered an at-risk statement. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to our commercial products and the medicines in our pipeline, and particularly those inherent in the process of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines that are safe and effective for use as human therapeutics, and in the endeavor of building a business around such medicines. Ionis' forward-looking statements also involve assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove correct, could cause its results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although Ionis' forward-looking statements reflect the good faith judgment of its management, these statements are based only on facts and factors currently known by Ionis. As a result, you are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These and other risks concerning Ionis' programs are described in additional detail in Ionis' annual report on our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our most recent Form 10-Q quarterly filing, which are on file with the SEC.

as part of the nation's efforts to create its own electric vehicle supply chain.\nCompared to the size of its population, India's car market is tiny. Tata Motors dominates its electric vehicle (EV) sales, which made up just 1% of India's total car sales of about 3.8 million last year.\nA joint statement on the memorandum of understanding, between Tata's unit Agratas Energy Storage Solutions and the government of the western state of Gujarat, said work on the plant, to be based in Sanand, northern Gujarat, was expected to start in less than three years.\nIt would have initial manufacturing capacity of 20 Gigawatt hours (GWh), which could be doubled in a second phase of expansion, the statement said.    \n\"The plant will go a long way in contributing to the development of the EV ecosystem in Gujarat and India,\" Vijay Nehra, an official in the Gujarat state government told Reuters.      \n($1 = 82.3373 Indian rupees)\n\n (Reporting by Sumit Khanna and Tanvi Mehta; editing by Barbara Lewis)\nBy Sumit Khanna\n \u00a9 Reuters 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocks mentioned in the articleChangeLast1st jan.\n\nTATA MOTORS LIMITED\u00a02.21% 567.95 46.34%\n\nTOPIX INDEX\u00a0-0.67% 2191.5 16.63%\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll news about\u00a0TATA MOTORS LIMITED\n\n\n\n\n04:46aTata Motors : Submission of presentation to be made to the Analysts/Investors on Tata Moto..PU\n\n06/06Indian shares close flat in run-up to RBI, Fed meetsRE\n\n06/05Tata Motors registered total sales of 74,973 units in May 2023; Total PV Sales of 45,98..AQ\n\n06/05Tata Motors today launches the upgraded Nexon EV MAX XZ+ LUX; Made feature rich with a ..AQ\n\n06/05Positive Global Sentiment Lifts Indian Equities Amid Mixed US Jobs DataMT\n\n06/05Tata Motors : Intimation of Analyst / Institutional Investor(s) Meeting(s) from June 5, 20..PU\n\n06/02Tata Motors : today launches the upgraded Nexon EV MAX XZ+ LUXPU\n\n06/02India's Tata Group signs $1.6 billion EV battery plant dealRE\n\n06/02Should A Court Intervene In Matters Relating To Tenders And Contracts?AQ\n\n06/02Tata Motors' Passenger Vehicle Sales Rise 6% in May, Commercial Vehicle Sales Down 12%MT\n\n\n\nMore news\n\n\n\n\nAnalyst Recommendations on\u00a0TATA MOTORS LIMITED\n\n\n\n\n05/22Crisil Raises Tata Motors Rating to AA; Outlook StableMT\n\n05/15Nomura Adjusts Tata Motors' Price Target to INR610 From INR508, Keeps at BuyMT\n\n05/15Jefferies Adjusts Tata Motors' Price Target to INR665 From INR600, Keeps at BuyMT\n\n\n\nMore recommendations\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancials INRUSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales 2023\n\n3\u00a0377\u00a0B\n40\u00a0906\u00a0M\n40\u00a0906\u00a0M\n\n\n\nNet income 2023\n\n-5\u00a0970\u00a0M\n-72,3\u00a0M\n-72,3\u00a0M\n\n\n\nNet Debt 2023\n\n852\u00a0B\n10\u00a0317\u00a0M\n10\u00a0317\u00a0M\n\n\n\nP/E ratio 2023\n-306x\n\n\nYield 2023\n0,01%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitalization\n\n2\u00a0036\u00a0B\n24\u00a0668\u00a0M\n24\u00a0668\u00a0M\n\n\n\nEV / Sales 2023\n0,86x\n\n\nEV / Sales 2024\n0,63x\n\n\nNbr of Employees\n73 608\n\n\nFree-Float\n57,2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Financials\n \n\n\n\n\nChart\u00a0TATA MOTORS LIMITED\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDuration : \nAuto.\n2 months\n3 months\n6 months\n9 months\n1 year\n2 years\n5 years\n10 years\nMax.\n\n\n\r\nPeriod : \nDay\nWeek \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull-screen chart\n\n\n \n\nTechnical analysis trends TATA MOTORS LIMITED\n \nShort TermMid-TermLong TermTrendsBullishBullishBullish \n\nTechnical analysis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Statement Evolution\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser's settings to use dynamic charts. \nMore Financials\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\nSellBuy\n\n\nMean consensus\nBUY\n\n\nNumber of Analysts\n31\n\n\nLast Close Price\n567,95\u00a0INR\n\n\nAverage target price\n606,63\u00a0INR\n\n\nSpread / Average Target\n6,81%\n\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPS Revisions \nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser's settings to use dynamic charts. \nMore Estimates Revisions\n\n\nManagers and Directors\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Flack\nCo-President & Chief Purchasing Officer\nRajendra Petkar\nCo-President & Chief Technology Officer\nRavindra Kumar G.P\nCo-President & Chief Human Resources Officer\nPathamadai B.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This news release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements (collectively \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the ability to appeal the judicial ruling, and any other statements regarding the business plans, expectations and objectives of American Lithium. Forward-looking statements are frequently identified by such words as \"may\", \"will\", \"plan\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"estimate\", \"intend\", \u201cindicate\u201d, \u201cscheduled\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d, \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cpotential\u201d, \u201csubject\u201d, \u201cefforts\u201d, \u201coption\u201d and similar words, or the negative connotations thereof, referring to future events and results. Forward-looking statements are based on the current opinions and expectations of management and are not, and cannot be, a guarantee of future results or events. Although American Lithium believes that the current opinions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available at the time, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements since American Lithium can provide no assurance that such opinions and expectations will prove to be correct. All forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to: American Lithium\u2019s ability to achieve its stated goals;, which could have a material adverse impact on many aspects of American Lithium\u2019s businesses including but not limited to: the ability to access mineral properties for indeterminate amounts of time, the health of the employees or consultants resulting in delays or diminished capacity, social or political instability in Peru which in turn could impact American Lithium\u2019s ability to maintain the continuity of its business operating requirements, may result in the reduced availability or failures of various local administration and critical infrastructure, reduced demand for the American Lithium\u2019s potential products, availability of materials, global travel restrictions, and the availability of insurance and the associated costs; the judicial appeal process in Peru, and any and all future remedies pursued by American Lithium and its subsidiary Macusani to resolve the title for 32 of its concessions; the ongoing ability to work cooperatively with stakeholders, including but not limited to local communities and all levels of government; the potential for delays in exploration or development activities; the interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of mineral deposits; the possibility that any future exploration, development or mining results will not be consistent with our expectations; risks that permits will not be obtained as planned or delays in obtaining permits; mining and development risks, including risks related to accidents, equipment breakdowns, labour disputes (including work stoppages, strikes and loss of personnel) or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in exploration and development; risks related to commodity price and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; risks related to foreign operations; the cyclical nature of the industry in which American Lithium operates; risks related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms or delays in obtaining governmental approvals; risks related to environmental regulation and liability; political and regulatory risks associated with mining and exploration; risks related to the uncertain global economic environment and the effects upon the global market generally, , any of which could continue to negatively affect global financial markets, including the trading price of American Lithium\u2019s shares and could negatively affect American Lithium\u2019s ability to raise capital and may also result in additional and unknown risks or liabilities to American Lithium. Other risks and uncertainties related to prospects, properties and business strategy of American Lithium are identified in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of American Lithium\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis filed on May 29, 2023, and in recent securities filings available at www.sedar.com. Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. American Lithium undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by applicable securities laws. Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  Cautionary Note Regarding Macusani ConcessionsThirty-two of the 169 concessions held by American Lithium\u2019s subsidiary Macusani, are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes (together, the \u201cProcesses\u201d) in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared Macusani\u2019s title to 32 of the concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. In November 2019, Macusani applied for injunctive relief on 32 concessions in a Court in Lima, Peru and was successful in obtaining such an injunction on 17 of the concessions including three of the four concessions included in the Macusani Uranium Project PEA. The grant of the Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) has restored the title, rights and validity of those 17 concessions to Macusani until a final decision is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. A Precautionary Measure application was made at the same time for the remaining 15 concessions and was ultimately granted by a Court in Lima, Peru on March 2, 2021 which has also restored the title, rights and validity of those 15 remaining concessions to Macusani, with the result being that all 32 concessions are now protected by Precautionary Measure (Medida Cautelar) until a final decision on this matter is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process. The favourable judge\u2019s ruling confirming title to all 32 concessions from November 3, 2021 represents the final stage of the current judicial process. However, this ruling has recently been appealed by MINEM and INGEMMET. American Lithium has no assurance that the outcome of these appeals will be in the Company\u2019s favour.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll news about\u00a0AMERICAN LITHIUM CORP.\n\n\n\n\n06/07Sector Update: Energy Stocks Rising Late WednesdayMT\n\n06/07Sector Update: Energy Stocks Rising in Afternoon TradingMT\n\n06/07Sector Update: EnergyMT\n\n06/07American Lithium to Transfer Macusani Uranium Project's Ownership to Friday's Dog Holdi..MT\n\n06/07American Lithium Says Reached Definitive Agreement to Spin Out Macusani Uranium Deposit..MT\n\n06/07American Lithium Brief: Says Reached Definitive Agreement to Spin..MT\n\n06/07American Lithium Reaches Definitive Agreement to Spin Out\u00a0Macusani Uranium Deposit into..GL\n\n06/05American Lithium Announces Financial Highlights for Year Ended February 28, 2023 and Op..AQ\n\n06/02Surge Battery Metals Announces $7,160,000 Non-Brokered Private Placement Including a St..AQ\n\n06/02American Lithium Drops 1% in Premarket Trading as Its Fiscal Q4 Loss WidensMT\n\n\n\nMore news\n\n\n\n\nAnalyst Recommendations on\u00a0AMERICAN LITHIUM CORP.\n\n\n\n\n03/06American Lithium To Fast-Track Completion Of Pre-Feasibility Study For Falchani Project..MT\n\n03/01B.

Africa-focused lithium and gold-focused exploration and development company - On Wednesday said final assay results at Bougouni lithium project confirm high-grade mineralisation with additional high-grade lithium mineralised intersections at the Boumou, Bougouni South and Ngoualana prospects. Boumou is a high-priority target for further drilling to extend and define pegmatite bodies and allow for new resource estimate. Company also confirms further extension to June 30 of deadline for completion of funding package announced on January 19, agreed with Kodal Mining UK Ltd, Hainan Mining Co Ltd and its UK subsidiary Xinmao Investment Co Ltd. Hainan had agreed to acquire 51% of Kodal Minerals for USD100 million plus USD17.75 million equity subscription at 0.5p per share. Original deadline was April 30, first extended to May 31. Conditions still not yet satisfied include the transfer of Bougouni to a new Mali mining company owned by Kodal Mining.\n\nChief Executive Officer Bernard Aylward says all parties \"continue to work together to finalise all conditions precedent for the completion of the funding package. While it is disappointing that we have not yet finalised this process...the parties remain committed to the transaction and are working together on the preliminary engineering and development processes required to ensure we move quickly into development upon completion and receipt of funds.\"\n\nCurrent stock price: 0.63 pence, down 0.9% in London on Friday\n12-month change: up from 0.28p on June 6, 2022\n\nBy Emma Curzon, Alliance News reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

Tenure comprises West Oyo, Kwara State and Ekiti State lithium project areas in south-west Nigeria \"within close proximity\" to Lagos and Cotonou. Company aims to develop its first large-scale lithium mine without selling down ownership positions or dilute existing shareholders. It also will continue to prioritise explorations at Segilola gold mine, also in Nigeria.\n\nChief Executive Officer Segun Lawson says: \"While gold remains fundamental to our growth strategy, we consider the virtually untapped lithium potential of Nigeria to be an opportunity that is too good to miss, particularly given our established in-country presence, experience and first-mover advantage.
